  <strong>&#8220;&#8230;Rehoboth&#8230;&#8221;</strong>
</h1>

**Key Text**: **Genesis 26:15-21**

There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.

The correlation between Abraham’s and Isaac’s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.

### Reassurance {#reassurance}

The appearance of God to Isaac was not a sudden strike of the moon at noontide. God came with promises. According to <a class="NETBibleTagged">Genesis 22</a>, if well recalled, Isaac became God’s possession being offered as a relegated idol on Mt. Moriah. He cut a covenant with God as a living sacrifice – holy and acceptable to God. Thence, God’s appearance to Isaac in Philistine was devoid of that famous line, “Fear not.” Also, God’s appearance contrasted with Jacob was bereft of the ignorance displayed by Jacob. He said, “God was here, and I know it not.” He, in fact, did not know God. For if he knew Him, he would have anticipated Him on this journey, such that His appearance will not come as a rude shock.

That notwithstanding, based on the existing relationship between God and Isaac, God visited Him to reassure Him. What was the reassurance all about? Abraham had taught Isaac about God’s covenant with his lineage and how to obey the God of that covenant. The fulfilment was necessary to help this man in his pilgrimage. Therefore, God needed to speak to reassure him. No doubt, Isaac knew about his father’s ordeals. Abraham witnessed territorial famine, Isaac, too. So, he wouldn’t be wrong following his father’s footsteps to relocate. Friends, I hope the role model you are currently following is in intimate covenant with the Most High God? If not, stop and do a personal examination of that mentor or human handler (Discipler).

How God speaks once and makes us hear twice. Fast-forward to the challenges he faced seeking the fulfilment of God’s promise. I do not suppose that if he had not been ministered to with a second visit by God, he would easily have slipped to Egypt. How beautiful, for your journey, brother, that for a landmark pilgrimage in your life, you seek reassurance. Marriage is one of those lifelong sojourns; career is another.

There was an existing promise to Abraham, his father. Isaac had also had a personal encounter with God. But God knew his need and came to reassure Him that this generational promise would be fulfilled. Dear brother, you may not find God doubly advancing towards you for your journey. But has He not asked us to seek His face? Upon assurance, seek reassurance: it is not an act of doubt but of faith deepening. For not you, but the One who leads know what lies ahead. And He would be faithful to help.

Note, however, the matters surrounding this reassurance. It had **instructions**: _“Do not go down to Egypt… dwell in this land.”_ And Connected to it were **promises**: _“…I will be with you and bless you… I will perform… I will make… I will give…”_ There is also a basis for reassurance – all the _“I will’s”_ were _“…because Abraham obeyed”_ His _“voice and kept”_ His _“charge, commandments, statutes and laws.”_

Are you seeking reassurance on a subject with God to no avail? Check how well you have kept your side of an erstwhile bargain of His. If you have messed it all up, kindly make it all up by repenting. And what do you think the next step to Rehoboth will be? Watch out!

Shallom.

Every Blessing in Christ.
