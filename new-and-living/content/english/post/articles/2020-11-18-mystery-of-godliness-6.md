The fundamental issue of being born again was raised by Christ before Nicodemus in John 3. This was because of the kind of life Nicodemus carried, but he was not aware of it. The problem with mankind is the specie of life he carries about in this earthen vessel. Mankind is not aware of the fallen nature dwelling within him, because nothing happened to the body (the container). But as he continually lives, he discovers that there is warfare (an inner struggle) within as touching his decision, emotions and feelings.

So, in this section, we shall discover the origin of this constant inner turmoil between the flesh and the spirit. We find that the desires of the fallen man are constantly opposed to that of the spirit. This brings a conflict of interest to mankind, so that the man is prevented from doing what he desired to do.

Therefore, it is only GOD who can deliver a man from sin. God has made provisions for our deliverance &#8211; even from sins and sinful habits. The answer to the stubborn problem of the flesh is not in the legal codes or rules and regulations like: &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch this&#8221; – &#8220;Don&#8217;t drink this&#8221; – &#8220;Don&#8217;t watch this.&#8221; The Good news is that GOD has made the provisions for our daily living and victory from sin. But first, let us examine from the book of Galatians some examples of activities (products of the Old Man &#8211; Mr. Flesh) before looking at the provisions.

Our dual problems were ‘**_sin_**’ and ‘**_sins_**.&#8217; And we needed deliverance from them. The synonym of sins is iniquities (plural) and that of sin is iniquity (singular).

#### 1.1    Subsection (THE MEANING AND ORIGIN OF SIN):

“**_Sins means the (products) of the sinful nature. And Sin means the (producer) or manufacturer of sins”_**. (Isaiah 53:5-6 AKJV)

_But **he** was wounded for our transgressions,__  
he was bruised (pierced) for our iniquities **(sins)**:  
the chastisement of our peace was upon him;  
and with his stripes, we are healed.  
_ **_<sup> </sup>_**_All we like sheep have gone astray;__  
we have turned everyone to his own way;  
and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity **(sin)** of us all._

 **Questions for our learning:**

  * _Who is the person being referred to in this verse?_
  * _For what reason(s) was ‘he’ bruised or pierced?_ 
  * _With what was the person being referred to in this verse being pierced?_
  * _Was it a coincidence that the Bible distinguished between your iniquity and iniquities in these two verses?_ 
    #### 1.2 THREE ASPECTS OF SIN

  1. a) GOD&#8217;s aspect &#8212;&#8211; Habak. 1:13; Rom. 3:9-10. Sin violates God&#8217;s nature and eternal law. And God who is holy within and without cannot wink at sin, for He knows the nature of man.
  2. b) Man&#8217;s Aspect &#8212;&#8211; Luke 15:18; Gen.5:3. When a man falls into sin, it terminates and isolates him from God&#8217;s presence. So, the man went about multiplying offspring&#8217;s in his likeness and the image of the fallen nature.
  3. c) Satan&#8217;s Aspect &#8212;&#8211; Rev. 12:10-11; Job. 1:9-10. As a result of (b), the devil (our accuser) was cast down; for he constantly accuses man before GOD.

####    1.3 <u>WHAT IS SIN?</u> (1John 3:4; 5:17)

<sup> </sup>All unrighteousness is sin. Whoever sins also commits lawlessness. No man can undo or uncheck his sin. Sin is our enemy and God&#8217;s answer to the problem of sin is not by shouting, not by chatting, but by the instrumentality of the Cross.

This is why the teaching of the Cross is central to the Gospel and Christianity. The Gospel is about our redemption through CHRIST; our justification by his blood; the atoning sacrifice of His blood and our on-going repentance from sin. It is also our on-going sanctification through faith in what Christ has done for us and who He is.

Sin is an immoral act. It means to ‘**_MISS THE MARK’_**&#8211; an act of disobedience; a transgression of the law of GOD. It is the act of lawless passion. It is unruly, unbridled and unrestrained. And behind every confusion, chaos, disorder, an act of irresponsibility and anarchy is SIN!

Any thought in the heart; every disobedience; evil intent of the mind; any word spoken or wrong act done against GOD (or man) &#8211; by despising His Person or grieving the Holy Spirit or by rejecting the Word of God is SIN.

####    1.4 <u>ORIGIN OF SIN</u><u>.</u>

GOD’S divine nature is holiness within and without. And by His divine nature, He has the right to set standards for mankind’s righteousness &#8211; Rev. 4:11 KJV. Therefore, all mankind **MUST** account to Him for their actions, thoughts, and words done in this body. (**Rom. 14:12; 1Pet. 4:5**).

The first man and woman were innocent in the beginning. They were created by GOD as being sinless and good. They were creations of GOD bearing about His glory and light-life about. They were not afraid of the wild and ferocious beasts in the garden. There was no need to be afraid though because they were filled with His glory; for they were created in His image. (**Gen. 1:27; 2:7 AKJV)**.

God use to come down in the cool of the day to fellowship with the man and the woman. They were used to the voice and presence of the Lord in the garden of Eden. The relationship they had with God was intimate and special. God&#8217;s presence with them consistently revealed to them the path of life; the man and the woman looked forward to the presence of God, which is the fullness of joy. All around Him was everlasting pleasures.

However, they lost their innocence, perfection through disobedience [sin] and were driven out of the garden. They rejected the commandments of GOD when they took the forbidden fruit. Though they still lived, they had lost the glory, presence and protection of GOD. (**Gen. 3:5, 6-7, 9, 10, 17-19 KJV).** They became a mere living-corpse the moment they both ate the forbidden fruit. God passed his judgment upon them and the devil. God cursed the ground that bears fruit (the relationship of man to the ground became a sort of hostility as judgment fell upon the man&#8217;s primary role).

The Adamic race began to labour with a diminishing law of return, so to say. It is clear from here that the sin of mankind has extensive effects on creation &#8211; (Deut. 11:13-17, 28; Rom. 8:22; Gen. 4:12; 6:7) Though, the container remained un-bruised and un-wounded; though their eyes were opened; but to what would you say that their eyes were opened to; and to what extent is this curse of God on the relationship of man and the ground?                                                                                                             

(**N: B** The problem is never the container or the body, but the soul &#8211; which makes up of our thoughts, will and emotions). The natural man is the content inside the body. And disobedience with this natural man is intrinsic. He always struggles to obey God, but cannot, because of the innate carnal nature.
