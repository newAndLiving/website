  <strong>KEY TEXT: Rev. 12:10-11 (NKJV).</strong>
</p>

So, for you to overcome the devil and his constant accusations, it is not by your own effort but by the “**Blood of the Lamb and by the Word of your testimony**.”

  1. It is not by shouting; talking about it; not by speaking in tongues; not by covering it up. But by acknowledging it, by genuine confession, true repentance and the appropriation of the Blood of JESUS.
  2. As you draw nearer to GOD, the light of His Word exposes any darkness within us; then, we become convicted.

  * Then, through faith in the Blood provision, the LORD (by His Spirit) cleanses us from our sins.

**HANDLING THE ACCUSER**

The most common weapon used by our accuser is condemnation or guilt. The Bible says that he accuses us before GOD day and night (Rev.12:10). But thanks be to GOD for the Word of Testimony which says, &#8220;_There is_ _**<u>therefore now</u>** no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. <sup> </sup>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death. (Rom. 8:1) KJV_

So, in reality when the Devil accuses us, we must note that this is his job. He is both the accuser and the resister. For example, the devil will say, “See you, and you call yourself a believer, but you have just lied to your boss; and yesterday you also lied to your wife. The next lie is to your children. You are covering up because of being found out. Do you see yourself? Liar! Shame on you!”

So, what must you do? When you are confronted with such blatant accusation, it is instructive that you do not try to help yourself. Do not entertain self-defence, but draw nearer to the Cross and deeper to His precious bleeding side in faith. This is where God&#8217;s love and mercy can find you. Also, you must have confidence in the accomplished power of the Blood of Jesus and His Cross for your daily deliverance.

The other common error of judgment is that we accept the devil’s condemnation or guilt, which plunges us deeper into self-condemnation or guilt trip. This is the root cause of discouragement and despair among believers.

Consequently, as we embark on these two faulty ways, our reasoning becomes weak and our tender conscience becomes impaired. Then our sense of GOD becomes so obscured. Finally, we become separated from the LORD, and guilt sets into our mind like a mighty terrible flood beyond our control.

But when we turn to the LORD, look to the Cross through faith in Christ accomplished work of redemption by the blood of His everlasting covenant and by His Word of testimony, we experience constant deliverance from the accuser (the devil). (Heb. 12:2; Rev. 12:10-11; Rom. 8:33-34. NKJV, NIV, NLT, GNT). Check other translations.

** PRACTICAL DISCUSSIONS:**

  1. What do you do when you are accused falsely? Do you help yourself or deny yourself? Share your life experience with others.
  2. What would you do when men falsely accuse you and insult you or when they call you names? Do you reply? Share your thoughts with others in light of our study so far.

  * Read 2 Sam. 16:5-13, identify the issues raised and discuss the personal practical steps to take to resolve them in this passage.
