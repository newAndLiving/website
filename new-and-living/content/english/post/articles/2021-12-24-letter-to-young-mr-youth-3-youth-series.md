**<u>Texts</u>****: Genesis 26: 22 – 25**

Dear Reader,

Hearty greetings to you, the family and friends in this season of heralding the love of God through Christ Jesus. I bring this Christmas edition to you from the first book of the Bible, Genesis 26:22-25.

The events recorded in this chapter took place after Abraham’s death. It pointed to the fact that divine promises to Abraham have been passed unto Isaac. The season of famine was not strange to Isaac, for he had witnessed a similar situation in the days of his father Abraham, who went ‘_down_’ into Egypt without seeking God’s face. So, it was natural for him to decide to relocate to Egypt as well for survival. This seems to be the best choice at his disposal. My friend, what is your own best choice in your famine right now? Are you also thinking of going down to Egypt?

Interestingly, on this occasion, after Isaac had discussed with King Abimelech, he too decided to go ‘_down’_ to Egypt. But, the Lord appeared to him, and said, ‘_Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell thee of:’_ Precious friend, who is your own ‘_Abimelech_’ that you are quietly having strange discussions with in order to validate your fast exit from that marriage, career, location, course etc?

As I looked into this narrative, I discovered that God is a ‘_Covenant keeping God’_. He alone has divine wisdom to determine your famine_,_ duration and expiration. The Lord’s covenant with Abraham was Canaan and not Egypt. Hence, God now instructed Isaac to remain in the Promised Land, and that He will bless him for doing so; ‘_I will establish the covenant that I swore to Abraham’_ (Gen.22:16-18), and the substance of this promise is reiterated in this narrative. And as I carefully follow this passage, I equally believe that your own abiding, abounding and abundant fruitfulness is premised on the promises, and visions of God for your life.

Beloved, what I want you to know is that, not only was Isaac heir to the promises made by God, their fulfilment is intimately linked to him and his descendants. Do you know that through Christ Jesus, we also are Abraham’s offspring and joint-heirs to the same promise? Please take a brief moment and internalise this statement!

So, for this Abrahamic covenant to be ours, God sent forth His Son-Jesus, born of a woman through the Holy Spirit, but under the law, to redeem those who were under the bondage of the law and tyranny of sin, so that, we might receive adoption as sons (same and equal right as Isaac). And because we are sons, God’s Holy Spirit is saying to the believers, that ‘_but now…_’ sojourn in your own ‘Gerar’ no matter your famine! ‘Gerar’ here typifies your divine location or position. The famine is just for a while because a fruitful harvest is on the way. Do you know that the place of your exit is actually your place of bountiful harvest? So, remain there in obedience to the instructions of the Lord. Bear in mind that, it is obedience that the Lord is testing here.

Beloved, as I noted in Gen 26:22, there is a “_but now…_” in the move of God this season for you and your family. So, contrary to all expectations and facts before you, I am glad to announce to you that the Lord has decided to make large rooms for you. For this reason, let it settle in your mind that, regardless of the contentions, hostilities, delays, rejections, God is not powerless. ‘But now…’ contrary to all odds against you, God has decided to still make large rooms for you. Amen!

‘_But now…_’ means that you have to put all that behind you. They have become ashes. Do not dwell on ashes. They are extinguishers of God’s promises for your life. They are also not pleasant to the eyes. You must, therefore, pack them out of sight and out of mind.

Friend,

I want you to know that it is not that God was less powerful to intervene and stop you from your contention with self-life **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God was blind and deaf to all the insult and assault at you **but now&#8230;**

It is not actually about your skill and ability, it is just that God&#8217;s time to step into your situation has not yet reached the peak **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God just closed His eyes to the sins, and wickedness in the world **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God could not deal with the sinful nature, and the corruption in the society, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God was weak or slack in His promises to save and bless, it is only that He is patient awaiting men to turn away from dead works and have faith towards Him, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God cannot deal with those distorting the truth, creating psychological fear and warmongering in the world, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God had been removed from His throne or that the increase of His government is no more on Jesus&#8217;s shoulders, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God is not aware of the LGBTQ+ mobilisation, climate change issues, He is only been patient to save many who are profaned in mind, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God cannot stop human trafficking, child abuse, sex exploitation **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God cannot stop the Islamic extremists in Nigeria, the Middle East, Europe, but since He has put His Church in charge, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God is unaware of the divisions, decay and deplorable conditions of the Church of Christ, even though Christ is still the head, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God is panicking over the solution to the Covid-19 Global Health crisis and the peddling culture by the pharmaceutical Industries, **but now&#8230;**

It is not that God is unmindful of millions of lost souls, Fulani herdsmen senseless killings and kidnappings, and corruption in Nigeria, but now&#8230; God has decided to arise and remind the Adamic race of His divine sovereignty, ownership, and providence to all, in spite of all the wickedness in the world.

**_“But Now…”_** means enough is enough, I have put all these behind me, I have seen that human thoughts are constantly evil. I have decided not to contend with man. It is high time I started raising a fresh crop of New Creation men/women as agents of transformation through the instrument of **<u>DISCIPLESHIP</u>** to occupy (sow in righteousness, faith, prayer, time, active goodness etc) till I come.

Friends, I pray the Lord will open your spiritual eyes to see what He is saying to you. As for me, I see God making room for us in the House of assemblies, House of parliament, Palaces, cabinet offices, the legislative, the judiciary, the executive, education and academic research, sports, culture, music, to re-crop new species of men as agents of revival in the nations for the glorious appearance of His Son-Jesus Christ.

We have come to the days of His power. It is the season of the birth of the Prophetic and Apostolic movements. It has both divine direction and divine strategy. This move is unstoppable, undeniable, and of surpassing scope and dimension.  It must not be a monument. It is a dynamic movement. We must not form personality cults, not build an empire, not be religious, no overemphasis and denominational dogmas. It must not be eroded and damned. It is to dig, dig, dig, deep into the hearts of men the Gospel of Christ until their hearts touches the springs of living water, be filled, and in turn pour into others. It is not about ‘my’, ‘our’ denomination. It must not be localized, marginalised and contaminated. It is a Revival! It must flow to all nations. God himself will supervise and administer it by His Holy Spirit into all nations. This is the season of establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth! For Heaven has made room for us. Contrary to all expectations, we now have the divine opportunity to be fruitful even in times like this&#8230;

Therefore, we must arise and take responsibility for this commission and by God&#8217;s grace we shall! Strangely this Rehoboth is never negative nor positive. It is the reason for the season. It is to multiply disciples in the nations, to populate the kingdom of God and depopulate hell. It is a season to multiply abundantly, for God has made room for us. So, if you are willing and obedient I say, &#8221; _fear not&#8230;_&#8220;; for the Lord is with you, He will bless and multiply your obedience abundantly, aboundingly and abidingly for Jesus&#8217;s sake. Arise today, go up to your own Beersheba, and make a covenant with God as a living sacrifice.

So, just as Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year hundred-fold, God is ready to bless you too, if you are willing and obedient to sow in His chosen place for you. Dare to dwell in the promised land, sow in righteousness and to the Spirit? Then be ready to experience multiplication, fruitfulness, and enlargement.

Finally, it is instructive to remind you that, though God has made the room for us in this famine, it is not the season to quarrel, seek revenge, engage jealousy and envy, but to legislate Christ light-life, multiply disciples and to prepare men for Heaven.

**<u>What to do</u>**

* Arise and take up responsibility for this commission this Christmas season.
* Come to God in sincere repentance from your sins and have faith towards Him.
* Do not fear, make a Holy Covenant with God as a living sacrifice;
* Enlarge the place of your tent, clear lots of ground for your tents!  
    Make your tents large. Spread out! Think big!  
    Use plenty of rope,  
    drive the tent pegs deep.  
    You’re going to need lots of elbow room  
    for your growing family.  
    You’re going to take over whole nations;  
    you’re going to resettle abandoned cities.  
    Don’t be afraid—you’re not going to be embarrassed.  
    Don’t hold back—you’re not going to come up short.  
    You’ll forget all about the humiliations of your youth,  
    and the indignities of being a widow will fade from memory.  
    For your Maker is your bridegroom,  
    his name, God-of-the-Angel-Armies!  
    Your Redeemer is The Holy of Israel,  
    known as God of the whole earth.  
    You were like an abandoned wife, devastated with grief,  
    and God welcomed you back,  
    Like a woman married young  
    and then left,” says your God. (Isaiah 54:2-6)

Repent, and return to the Lord if you are currently on your way down to Egypt.

God has now made large room for us.

**_Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year_****!**
