  Absalom is dead (Part 3)
</h1>

### Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV)

**<u>The case of Absalom</u>**.

Beloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**&#8211; (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom. The is the first response that God demands from you. For you cannot follow Christ with such corrupt life. It is an impossible road to heaven. It cannot please God.

**Absalom is dead.** Absalom, representing the old man (Mr. Flesh). He is in conflict with David (King Jesus), and seeks to displace and dethrone Him is dead! His death certificate was signed, sealed, and delivered on the Cross of Calvary. Hallelujah!

However, like David, because of my affection/lust/affinity/attachment with this old man, there is a struggle to accept the fact of his death. There is a struggle to accept the unchanging and irreversible truth that he died with Christ on the Cross. (Rom.6.6; Gal.2:20 KJV).

David was struggling to accept that Absalom was dead but Absalom was not struggling because he was dead and gone. Do you know that in practical terms, this is the bane of our struggle with God?  It was the same struggle that Jacob lived with for 21 years before he had an encounter at the brook Jabbok. So, when Jacob could no longer continue with this long struggle, he held on to the man, but when the man saw that he would let him go, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of his thigh was out of joint, as Jacob wrestled with the man. David was struggling to come to terms with this.

So, my friend is this your situation? then, why don&#8217;t you too surrender? why don&#8217;t you yield your life and be still before the Lord to transform your corrupt lifestyle? Jesus is waiting for you. Don&#8217;t leave for too long. It might be too late.

Going on, though the death of our old man is an established and unchanging fact as revealed in the Word of God (Rom.6:6 KJV), a majority still struggle many times to accept this reality. They still live as if the Cross has not happened. They still cry over spilled milk. They still desire the garlic, cucumber of Egypt though they have physically left their Egypt. But spiritually in their mind, they have not reckoned (accounted) their Old Man (Absalom) as indeed dead.

Beloved, do you know that you are in Christ, Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new! And as such, you must reckon yourself alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord. In the case of David, he wrestled to accept the death of Absalom. Hence, he could not reckon it as great a victory what God did through the Armies of Israel in putting to death his enemy Absalom at the battle of Ephraim forest.

Furthermore, let us attempt to note few similarities between the death of Absalom and our Old Man: both have an eye for the throne, both were full of intrigues and smart schemes, both were proud and unruly. Both were disobedient, revengeful, and stubborn in all their ways. Both sought external glory instead of the inner beauty of peace and righteousness. Both loved to be worshipped and served. Both became fugitives and led the rebellion against their Master and Lord. Both were banished from the palace and the Kingdom. **Both died hanging on a tree with their heads crushed!**

Just like King David in this narrative, oftentimes we struggle to accept the death of our old nature which Christ put to death on the cross. The dangers of this struggle are these:

  * The people, instead of rejoicing and living in the victory that was obtained that day, were in mourning. The victory that day was turned into mourning and the people were moving around as though they were defeated in battle. ‘**_As the people heard of the king’s deep grief for his son, the joy of that day’s wonderful victory was turned into deep sadness. The entire army crept back into the city as though they were ashamed and had been beaten in battle’_**. (2Sam.19:2-3 TLB). I will have you know that this is one of the clever schemes of the devil to make a mockery of the Power of the Cross! You must not fall for this scheme. It is the lie of the devil.

Therefore, let it be known that the devil is a defeated foe. He lost the battle at Calvary when Jesus said, &#8216;**_It is finished_**. At this point, it is instructive for you to know that your failure to accept the death of the Old Man will make the enemy keep you in perpetual defeat.

As such, instead of living continuously in the victory that Christ purchased for you on the Cross, there is this inner struggle with sin, recurring defeat, and frustration. Consequently, it seems as though the Christian life cannot be lived in continuous, perpetual victory. This is a lie of the enemy and stems from the struggle to accept the settled death of the Old Man. But thanks be to God that on the Cross at Calvary our Old Man was crucified with Christ. (**_Romans 6:6-7 KJV_**) says, ‘**_Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin’_**.

  * Another danger is that, like David, our struggle to accept this death of the old man is likened to **showing ingratitude to Him who went to the Cross on our behalf.** This was what Joab was telling David (2Sam.19:5-6 KJV). And there is a big lesson here for you and me because it took Joab, David’s commander in chief to jolt David to his senses as it were.

Looking through these two verses, it is as if Joab was reminding David that, ‘**_You seem not to place value on the victory over Absalom death. We have saved your own life and that of your household by risking our own lives; and yet you act foolishly, making us feel stupid and ashamed for killing Absalom. And it is as if we have committed an abomination! You seem to love your evil-laden rebellious son than us who love you. But the way I see it, all our effort in risking our own dear lives is of no significant value to you. I am sure if Absalom had lived and we all died, would have pleased you right?_’**

The life application to this is that just like David slighted the victory on that day, even likewise, there are many so-called believers today who are slighting or reducing the priceless value of the finished work of Christ on the Cross. They are rejecting the Only Begotten-Son of God who gave His own precious life as a ransom to redeem mankind from the tyranny and bondage of sin and satan. They are turning their backs on the perfect substitute who took their place on the Cross through their unbelief.

Friend, are you also ungrateful like David? Would you rather prefer that you continue your old relationship with sin to Jesus? Do you also love your sinful friend more than Jesus? Does Jesus&#8217; sacrifice count more than the pleasures of sin? David was blinded by his love for his rebellious son, are you equally blindfolded by the god of this world such that you continuously fail to see the light of His glory shine in your hearts? To me, this ingratitude is shameful and troubling. What about you? please refrain from your ingratitude and unbelief. According to (Hebrew 3:13-19 NLT), many perished in the wilderness because of these things.

  * The other danger to this truth is the faulty perspective that the Cross is past and historical. And therefore, it is just a mere symbol or religious woodwork. This to me is a dangerous supposition. And it can be costly. No wonder the Church of today is weak and impotent in extending the gains of the Cross in its ministry. It is sad to see many churchgoers ignorant of the real meaning of the Cross and its effectiveness. (2Cor.4:3-4 KJV). Others even deny its power. And from such people the Bible says you should avoid.

But I will have you know that the power of the wondrous cross is real, active, living, and powerful to save the sinner and to deliver you from any demonic attack or household wickedness. This scripture says that;

‘**_For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect._**

  * **_For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. (1 Cor.__1_:17-18 KJV**) also read (**Rom.1:16-17 KJV)**. But you must note that the Cross is only a real-time to the man who continually looks at it in faith. Do not be fickle-minded about the finished work of the Cross. The Cross is the saving and keeping power for daily living.
  * The next danger is the substitution of the Cross for beggarly means. You must not fall for the subtle deception of the devil in rendering the Cross as being void and mere symbol. (Isa. 5:13-14 KJV). It is not so. The Cross is God&#8217;s comprehensive instrument for dealing with the Old Man. Our old man was crucified on the Cross at Calvary. Never believe the lie of the devil and do not compromise your faith. (Gal. 3:22-25 KJV). No sophistication or westernization can substitute for the power of the Cross. Not even technology can rival the efficacy of the Cross. Please note that even Jesus’ climax of ministry and obedience were both at the Cross. Whether it is an argument, sickness, quarrel, disobedience, corruption, poverty, tradition, etc, they all terminate at the Cross.
