####   1 .1   THE SINFUL NATURE

As we continue this lesson, please note that the original man and the woman GOD made in His own image in Genesis 2, is not the same as the one in Gen 3. Sin drew away the sinless life from this container (our body) and another life (sinful nature) invaded this human body. None of us saw the first Adam (in Gen. 2; 1, Cor.15:45).

So, what this means is that we inherited our sinful nature from the fallen man of Gen. 3. (Gen. 3:7-10, 12-13; Gen. 5:1-3 NKJV). Consequently, God is continually looking for a man who will perpetuate His divine purpose on the earth. This is because there was a quiet change in our original nature (in Gen. 2) after the fall of man. The fallen nature of man is the kind of specie of life he carried after the fall. A life that is corrupt, proud, disobedient, given to blames, excuses, cover-up and is totally selfish!

**<u>Pointer</u>**: The issue is that GOD is committed to making man with the light-life to replenish the earth, to legislate the Kingdom&#8217;s light-life and to drive away the darkness. But satan has committed himself to hijack this original concept and to cut it short. The reason is that Satan cannot create man, hence, all these aggressive researches into AI [WHAT IS &#8216;AI?], human digital technology and corruption through sin is to make man to serve him too.

So, when it seems that Satan is claiming that he has hijacked man and achieved his evil purpose through sin and disobedience, GOD decided to send JESUS, His only Begotten Son to come into this world in the likeness of human flesh to be the perfect sacrifice to die for our sins (Rom. 8:3 NIV; 2 Cor.5:21; Heb.2:14; 4:15). This will lead us to the examples of dead works.

**       1.2  BIBLICAL EXAMPLES OF DEAD WORKS TO BURY**

**Study Texts**: (Gal. 5:19-21; 2Cor. 12:20-21; 1Cor. 6:8-10; Rom 1:25-32; Rev. 21:8, Rev. 21:27; 22:15).

**<sup> </sup>****_<u>Now the works of the flesh are manifest</u>_**_: which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,_**_<sup> </sup>_**_idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. **(Gal. 5:19-21) AKJV.**_

**_<u>What human nature does is quite plain</u>_**_: It shows itself in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions;_**_<sup> </sup>_**_in worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups; they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before: those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God**. (Gal. 5:19-21 GNT**)_

_For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: _**_<sup> </sup>_**_and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed. **(2Cor. 12:20-21 AKJV**)_

_Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. **(1Cor.6:8-10 AKJV**_)

You will notice a list of few dead works in the passages above. They are examples of dead works to be repented from: They are dead works because there is no life in them. Dead works are anything we do or any thought that we think upon which are not initiated by God.  Whatever anyone does without the Holy Spirit behind it, or at work is but a dead work.

#### 1.3 **Dead works can be grouped into 2 main categories**.

  * Everything we did in the flesh before we came to Christ. It includes sins or works of the flesh dictated to us by the Old man. It means the works of the devil (1John 3:8). It is as simple as even church attendance, church ceremonies or church traditions done to earn the favour of God or man. It includes things we have done based on church rules and regulations, even though it seems reasonable or acceptable, but actually they are according to the law and not grace.
  * The second category is everything we do upon conversion that is void of the life-giving spirit of God &#8211; Rev.3:1-2; 2Sam.24:10, Exo.2:11-12. Whatever we do that is not initiated and endorsed by the Holy Spirit; and that is not from the Word of God, but the wisdom of men &#8211; is of this second category. It also includes church activities and church programmes that are without the unction of God.

We inherited this fallen nature in the garden of Eden through Adam and Eve. Though it seemingly looks as if nothing happened, the spirit of man became corrupted and degenerated. It became alive to sin. (Read Gen. 3:22; 4:1-17, 19, 23; 5:1-3). The soul became filled and flooded with the sin virus. The sin virus is worse than the COVID-19 virus. And the body is the outlet manifesting the dead works. Hence, the Good News Translation says_, &#8220;What the human nature does is quite plain.&#8221;_ 

In these two translations, it presents the flesh as a person who works, and whose work is obvious, and quite plain to see. For example, when you see a piece of furniture, it is quite plain that it was made by a carpenter or interior designer.  Equally, when you see a good dress, it is evident that it was made by a fashion designer and not a mechanic. That is why the scripture says, &#8220;By their fruits, you shall know them.&#8221; (Matt.7:16). You can identify what a man does by its works.  Just as life shows itself, so does sin show itself by its dead works.

You may be able to hide a particular sin for 20-30 years (e.g. Jacob and Esau), but one day it will expose you. It does not matter the class of people present. Sin by its nature brings shame and disgrace. It terminates your relationship with God and with people. It is because by nature the Mr. Flesh loves to show itself. You cannot cover up the flesh for too long. It will disappoint you in public.

The flesh will always demand for what belongs to him. He is older and cleverer than you are. Therefore, expose him _before_ it scatters all that you have built upon the foundations of lies and deceits. So, before it is too late, hand over yourself to God and confess your sins unto Him. In the NKJV, it gives us a list of these activities of Mr. Flesh:  _adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred etc.._ And the person who continually and habitually practice them, and others, though not mentioned here, will **<u>NOT</u>** inherit the Kingdom of GOD.
