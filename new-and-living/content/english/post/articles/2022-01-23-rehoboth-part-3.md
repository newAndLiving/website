  <strong>&#8220;&#8230;Rehoboth&#8230;&#8221;</strong>

### **Key Text**: **Genesis 26:1-22**

There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.

The correlation between Abraham’s and Isaac’s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.

### Restriction {#restriction}

      “<em>And the LORD appeared to him and said, ‘Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you. Live for a time in this land, and I will be… I will give… I will establish… I will multiply… Because Abraham obeyed Me and fulfilled his duty to Me, and kept My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.</em>”

It was an omnipotent God talking to a limited man. God could be anywhere at any time. But man can only be in one place at a time. So although God can be known uniquely in different locations globally, man is only well known if he can be associated with a particular place over a given period. Due to this, God has planned a place through substitution for Abraham. And every blessing that is associable with this covenant must be delivered within the confines of this location. Hence the restriction of Isaac’s protraction to Gerar.

Secondly, the blessings Isaac was to enjoy were not due to his own qualification. It is God fulfilling the promised terms of His covenant with Abraham. It had nothing to do with Isaac’s current keeping of God’s commandments, statutes, and laws. Instead, it had everything to do but one with Abraham’s. Therefore, Isaac only needed to obey God and be at the location of the fulfilment of God’s promise to Abraham. We can thus conclude that Isaac had to adhere to being locationally restricted to enjoy the boundless covenanted blessings due to Abraham. He had to be localized in famine to access his planned plenty. He must be constrained to enjoy a copious shower. Even likewise, must you be rightly located to enjoy the everlasting covenant through the Blood of Jesus!

Now God did not promise Abraham Egypt, Babylon, Ethiopia, Ephesus. He only said in verse 3, “…_for to you and your descendants I will give all these lands_.” This connoted Gerar was part of the land promised by God to Abraham, now being occupied by the Philistines and ruled by Abimelech.

Remaining in our inheritance or, better still, possessing our possession in God entails that we are confined to the location marked out for us. The earth is of the Lord and the fullness thereof. But only by an allotment, its fullness can be ours. The Lord created vast earth but allotted Eden to Adam to tend. He had the world as a vast empire to Himself but only gave David Israel to rule. He has the whole world to Himself but restricted the ministry of Jesus to Palestine. My submission is that being restrained and choosing between alternatives is a critical junction where one decides to ply or continue plying the road to Rehoboth or not.

Like his father, Abraham, Isaac might have decided for Egypt. The primary cause of famine in those days was drought. Digging wells lends evidence to this. And you don&#8217;t dig well wells in the rainy season but in the dry season. If there were rain, cisterns, no wells would have been drilled to hold water. However, Egypt did not need rain to survive. They had their profitable irrigation systems.

Moreover, the Nile river gave Egypt sources for its thriving large-scale commercial agriculture. It was crucial to the economic survival of other parts of the world whenever famine struck. It was a flourishing land, a centre of attraction for any capitalist. Thence, it was a natural place to descend for a man with many slaves and livestock.

Oh, our Christian walk shall ever be a walk of choosing between unseemly Gerar and a lushly Egypt! It will ever be a walk of choice between being driven by faith or sight. What an attraction Egypt always is at first sight! It always attracts our first imagination. But would an interruption or interception confine us to stand with God’s choice? Permit me to also, remind you of the Lot&#8217;s attraction to the plains of the Jordan valley. Although, it was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord. But, it was not actually the garden of the Lord. Please note that resemblance is different from reality.

Imagine digging well in the face of legally backed hijacking in Gerar. In contrast, there are readily available rivers and lakes where Isaac would pay to water his livestock in Egypt. Imagine residence at the mercy of Abimelech when one can afford acres of land in Egypt and live without incursion. These and more are the contravening circumstances existent in the locations to which we are restricted and the alternatives to which we might have descended. Yet, the just shall continue living by continually believing.

As we would, nevertheless, see, the state of the land at any point, through the eyes of faith, does not in any way inhibit God’s intention to bless and make abundantly fruitful. As indicated by this story, a land fraught with drought might be a veritable “riverside” by which our souls are planted, such that it brings forth its fruits in our seasons. Conversely, a land filled with greenery and fruitful fields may be full of thorns and briers that chokes every spiritual vitality out of our souls. The decider lies in deciphering God’s will. Better to be restricted and blessed in the end than to be left to a fall-headed free-flow. Till we leave this earth, each disciple blessings and ministry are localized. To be out of space is to be out of coverage.

Shalom.

Every Blessing in Christ.
