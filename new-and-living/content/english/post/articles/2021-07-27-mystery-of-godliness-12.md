**<span style="color: #ff6600;">KNOWING THIS…</span> (Romans 6:6)**

The majority of believers today are destroyed not because they pray; not because they fast; not because they do good deeds. But according to the Bible, God says, ‘My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. As good as self-discipline and rules in dealing with a problem are, they are only human efforts in dealing with the Old Man. Mankind will only continue striving and struggling with Mr. flesh by following strict rules and regulations. This is what the Bible calls self-righteousness.

However, if we exercise our faith and not our sight or strength, we are certain to have a personal revelation of the transaction that took place on the Cross. And the only way you can experience this is simply by “**KNOWING THIS…”** You don’t have to memorise, prophecy or speak in tongues**.** All you need to know is this truth, not many truths. Just this one thing, that the principle of life is DEATH. And this DEATH happened on the Cross at Calvary, where “**_Your Old Man and mine was crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth, we no longer serve sin”_**.

  1. Death is the principle of life. Rom. 7:1-4, Rom. 6:5, 7-8, Rom. 8: 32 KJV. For as long as a man lives, the law has dominion over the man. Just as a woman who has a husband is bound to him, so likewise we were bound to the **Old Man**. But when the right time came, God sent His Only Begotten Son &#8211; JESUS CHRIST, to deliver or separate us from the bondage of our ex-husband &#8211; Mr Flesh. But thanks be to God who did not spare his own Son, but delivered Him for us all as the perfect sacrifice on the Cross at Calvary!
  2. And by GOD’s divine working and timing, JESUS CHRIST paid the full price (DEATH) from the bondage of sin, self, the world system and satan. Your very SELF and my SELF was crucified with Him on the Cross. So, by faith in this truth, it is no longer I who lives, but Christ, who now lives in you and me, Hallelujah! (Rom. 6:6, Isa. 53:4-6, Heb. 2:9, 14-15, Gal. 2:20-21 KJV).
  3. You are now DEAD! (2Cor. 5:14, Col. 3:3, Gal. 2:20 KJV).

But I can hear you say, ‘But how? I am still alive?’ Yes, you are, but no longer of your old SELF, but the NEW CREATION MAN! (2Cor. 5:17; 1Cor. 6:19-20). N.B: the body (container) is still the same. Nevertheless, there is a New Creation Man &#8211; the Light-life of GOD in you right now. It takes faith and not sight to believe. This must be a daily revelation to you. You must keep substantiating &#8211; **KNOWING THIS**!  This New Creation Man is **JESUS CHRIST**. You must believe that you are DEAD. Because he that is dead is freed from sin. The life of sin was destroyed on the Cross. The very stronghold of sin has been broken and dismantled in your life. The flesh cannot be your master and ruler again. This truth has empowered you to say **‘NO’** to Mr Flesh and **&#8216;YES&#8217;** to CHRIST.

The resurrected LORD has bought you; your body now belongs to Him; so that He can dwell in you and walk in you in this world. (2 Cor. 6:19-20). He is the Light-life in you. You must understand this. **_<u>It can only come by a personal revelation from God that your Old life is terminated</u>_**. It passed away on the day you met CHRIST, accepted Him as your personal LORD and Saviour. That day you received the HOLY SPIRIT and became born again. A New Creature in CHRIST JESUS (Eph.1: 11, 14 GNB). Amen.

**QUESTION: What then should be your response to this divine truth?                                                       ** 

{2Cor. 5:15, Gal. 2:20, Rom. 6:1,2,11,13; Col. 3:5, 12-17; Rom. 12:1-2}.

At this point in this segment, it must be clear to you why JESUS died for mankind on the Cross. And also, why He drank the Mysterious Cup presented to Him in the Garden of Gethsemane. **_<u>The purpose for these things is that, you no longer live for and unto your SELF &#8211; the Old Man inside you; but for and unto JESUS. </u>_**

The next critical point is that you must refuse to bear fruit for Mr Flesh. This is because you are no more under his tyranny and bondage again. He is dead and buried away for life. You have been delivered once and for all from his slavery. This, you must keep knowing daily. Have you seen a drunken man certified dead by a pathologist still drinking? The answer is ‘**NO**!’ All the old things like drunkenness, cursing, silly talks perished with him in the grave. So, likewise, self and satan can no longer influence your life with sins. For you are DEAD, and your new life is hidden with Christ in God. For example, if a serpent swallows a lizard and the serpent is killed, what do you think happened to the lizard? The lizard also dies.

“**_So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ…” (Rom. 7:4a). NIV._**

The next instructive matter is to bear fruit meet for the New Creation Man. He is now at work in you, both to will and to do, of His own good purpose. (Phil. 2:13)

Your new ‘husband’ is now JESUS CHRIST. You must now live as He tells you to do. It is Him alone you must obey because you are now under new management. So, if you are certain that you died with CHRIST; certain that you were buried with CHRIST; certain that you have now risen with CHRIST; then you MUST now spontaneously seek those things which are above. You must now bear fruits meet for repentance &#8211; Fruits of the Spirit.

In terms of your affections, desires, tastes and appetites; you must deliberately now set them not on the things on the earth, but heavenly things. You must consciously fill and occupy your thoughts with things that are lovely; pure; true; praiseworthy; good virtue and just. You must take effort to exercise your faith in this Mystery of CHRIST death on the Cross by <u>REPLACING</u> dirty, evil, lustful and impure thoughts and desires <u>WITH </u>pure, good and just thoughts and desires. If you fail to actively say NO! to the devil and his temptations, he will come back strongly and multiply his demons in your desires. And your case will be more terrible than before.

**N.B**: Nature abhors a state of vacuum. We are not an angel. We are containers that must be filled. But be diligent to take guard of what goes in and comes out of your heart.

Finally, therefore, you must **<u>put off</u>** the Old Man and his works &#8211; fornication, adultery, covetousness, inordinate affection, lying etc. But don’t stop here.  In exchange, **<u>put on</u>** the New Man and his fruit of the spirit-love, faith, patience, kindness, gentleness, joy, meekness etc. Gal.5:22-23. Remember that your location, nature, and perspective have now changed from earthly issues to heavenly issues.

**DAILY APPLICATION OF THE NEW CREATION MAN LIFE**

Please let me remind you that as touching the divine exchange, the content new nature and thoughts, one thing remains constant -the physical body. Even though your friends and family may not understand your new faith, you must **<u>keep knowing </u>**that there is a GREAT change. Each time they ask you to show them proof that you are truly dead, you don’t need to. All you say to them is, “<u>I am sorry, the Old Man &#8211; your former acquaintance is dead; he passed away. The life in me is the New Creation Man Life &#8211; the resurrected LORD from heaven now dwells in me.</u>” You must learn this song in order to assist in your response to all their quest to/for their dead kinsman:

**<u>IT IS NO LONGER I THAT LIVETH </u>**

_It is no longer I that liveth (readeth, preacheth, teacheth, singeth)._

_                        But CHRIST that liveth in me (2ce)_

_                        He lives in me (2ce)_

_                        JESUS is the life in me_

_                        It is no longer I that liveth_

_                        But CHRIST that liveth in me._ 

Your deliverance is not through human ability or skills but through faith in the living word of God. As Romans 6:11 KJV says, “**_Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord”_**.

The word ‘**reckon**’ is an accounting terminology that means to count it, consider it. Inferring that when Christ died, you were inside of Him and that you too died with Him when your Old Man was crucified with Christ on the Cross.

Interestingly, the accounting profession is one of the professions that is based on historical records and facts. And since, the Cross is not a myth to you anymore but a fact, you too must equally deem it as factual, true and evidential. So, whether you believe it or not, Calvary has happened. CHRIST died on the Cross. Nothing can change it. No one can undo it. Not even satan! You must reckon it as true. And you are to live your life on this premise. And when He arose, we likewise were quickened by His resurrection power and life. Praise the Lord!

Having received the GRACE of God to be saved through faith in Christ death, you must now daily yield your members as instruments of righteousness. CHRIST is now the OWNER and OCCUPIER. He is not a tenant. He is the LORD. HE is the Husband and the Head. He did not borrow you, He bought you at a price FULLY PAID! He chose you by himself. You did not choose Him. So, start living daily in the FULLNESS of this gracious work and divine revelation of the death of CHRIST on the CROSS daily in JESUS name. Amen.

** ****PERSONAL EVALUATION**

  1. Please tell us what are the (old fixtures and fittings) dead works of Mr. flesh that you have identified and packed out of your own life?
  2. Someone once said that “it is only a fool who holds unto what he cannot keep, and do not keep what he can lose”. In the light of this statement, please share with others the former things you still love to keep and why?
  3. Do you think it is an offence to the world when we daily carry our Cross, to follow CHRIST?
  4. With a practical life experience, kindly share with others the principle of, “putting off the old life and putting on the new life”?
