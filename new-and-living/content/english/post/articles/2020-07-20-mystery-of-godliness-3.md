### Biblical Evidences and Meaning of the Flesh

#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Scriptural evidences that Christ came in the flesh

  * _Hebrews 4: 15; Matthew 16: 13-16;&nbsp;Matthew 1:&nbsp;23;&nbsp;**(NKJV, KJV, LB, NLT)**_
  * _Romans 8:&nbsp;3; Isaiah 53: 3;&nbsp;Colossians&nbsp;1: 14; 1 Peter 2: 24; 1&nbsp;John 1: 1 and Revelation 2:&nbsp;8&nbsp;**(NKJV, KJV, LB, NLT)**_

#### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence showing that Christ did not come with a different kind of flesh.

“**For indeed He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham**.&nbsp; Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things **pertaining to God, to** make propitiation for the sins of the people.&nbsp; For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to (succor) aid those who are tempted. (Hebrews 2: 16-18 KJV).

#### 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHY IS THIS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME?

  * Christ was tempted like every mankind but He did not yield to the temptation. A person who sins does not suffer when he is tempted, such&nbsp;a person chooses to sin and then suffers for the sin committed.
  * (Job&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;36&nbsp;verse&nbsp;21).&nbsp;Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction&nbsp;KJV.
  * But as for Christ, He suffered when He was tempted because He chose&nbsp;OBEDIENCE&nbsp;instead. He resisted the lust and temptation through obedience to God. Are you willing to do the same now?
  * Again, each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lusts and enticed.&nbsp;(James&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verse&nbsp;14&nbsp;says:&nbsp;But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.&nbsp;KJV). So, if Christ did not have the same flesh as man, then He could not have been able to save us through His death from our sins.
  * I discovered also, that He needed to take up the nature of Man (Seed of Abraham) so that in all things He will be accepted as a perfect sacrifice to meet the just demand of God. For it was not angels or animals that sinned but the seed of Abraham (of whom I am one).&nbsp;_Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;&nbsp;**(Romans&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verse&nbsp;3 KJV)**_
  * In addition, if He did not have flesh and blood like ours, how could He have been a High Priest who is merciful and kind in things pertaining to God? And make propitiation for our sins? Thank God for His wisdom.
  * To deny that Jesus came in the flesh is to nullify the Cross and His death. (**Philippians&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;10,&nbsp;says,&nbsp;**_That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.&nbsp;(KJV)_
  * **Philippians&nbsp;chapter 3 verse&nbsp;18&nbsp;says,**_&nbsp;(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:_
  * Again, I noted the phrase ‘in all things’&#8230; This is very important for our learning that when the Bible says&nbsp;‘all things’ it means all, all is all. It neither means few things nor some things but&nbsp;**‘all things**.
  * And what do we mean by&nbsp;**‘in**&nbsp;**all things**’? it means in negative purposes whether it is a period of suffering, weakness, need, lack, pain, affliction, persecution, hatred, death, sorrow, grief etc, he felt what we now feel. He had the same experience, even much severe and difficult experience-death by hanging on the Cross!
  * And in positive purposes, as regarding Him being our merciful and faithful High Priest who has the human nature, that He may sympathize with us ‘**in all things’**

##### 1.3.1&nbsp; GROUP DISCUSSION

  * Discuss among yourselves the implications of the phrase&nbsp;**‘like His brethren**’ and ‘**to make propitiation’**&nbsp;for the sins of the people. What do you understand by this?
  * Describe how Jesus as High Priest was able to&nbsp;succor&nbsp;the people. In what way has He provided help for His brethren? Even for you?

#### 1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT THEN IS ‘’THE FLESH’’? (Galatians chapter 5 verses 15-17

_But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.&nbsp;&nbsp;**This I say then,&nbsp;walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.**&nbsp;For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.&nbsp;(KJV)_

**<u>Galatians chapter 5 verses&nbsp;19-21&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</u>**_Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,&nbsp;Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,&nbsp;envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God._

**The flesh is the will of a man, that does what is contrary to the Will of God. It has it operation sourced from what is called the Adamic nature, sinful nature is known** as the old man. This is the nature we all born of a woman inherited at our natural birth from Adam, It’s activities and its **works can be seen in the aforementioned scripture above in Galatians chapter 5 verses&nbsp;19-21 called the sin-location.**

And before we continue, let us examine briefly what then is the power of the flesh that kept us in bondage for ages before Jesus had to come in the human flesh to save us from? How did we come under this tyranny of sin? Why do I behave the WAY I DO?

In the Scripture, we have several references to the word&nbsp;**‘flesh’**. It connotes a different meaning. It simply means the physical body. But however, when the word flesh comes with a definite article,&nbsp;**‘the’**&nbsp;it actually refers to what we are about to briefly look into. And this is important for our study.

Whenever the prefix&nbsp;**‘the’**&nbsp;is used with the word flesh,&nbsp;**it clearly refers to that aspect of mankind that is estranged from God.**&nbsp;It is everything that opposes God, the Word of God, and the Spirit of God. The flesh refers to every aspect of the evil forces that control the air-kingdoms, principalities, etc. The flesh also refers to the body corrupted and ruined by sin. It is the Adamic sinful nature. It always rejects the law of God. It is that part of me when I want to do what is right but I find myself doing the opposite. It is the life within me that is at war with my mind and my members.

**It is the rebellious, stubborn, unruly,** and incorrigible part of man.&nbsp;It is the legal ground for sin,&nbsp;Satan, the world system, etc. It is the root of selfishness, self-confidence, the quarrel between parties, robbery, war, destruction, divorce, murder, slander, orgies, witchcraft, infidelity, demonic activities, etc. It does not accept simple correction; it seeks its own way and will. It weakens our reasoning. It impairs our tender conscience. It obscures or darkens our God&#8217;s sense and perspective. It gives us a defective view of Christ and the Word of God. It is completely anti-Gospel. It thrives in the cover-up&nbsp;(fig-leaves),&nbsp;blames game, and excuses. It distracts us away from whatever is spiritual and brings us into the carnal and natural. It creates enmity between us and God. It loves to dominate, intimidate, and manipulate people, circumstances, etc. It is the fallen nature&nbsp;(lower nature)&nbsp;of man. It always wants to be in control and have authority. It is the root of pride, love for money, and material things. It has many aliases namely;&nbsp;**_Mr. Flesh, The Carnal nature, The Sinful nature, Adamic nature, The Natural Man, and The Old Man_**&nbsp;to mention just a few.

**Genesis chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;7&nbsp;says:** And the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and _man became a living soul._

**Genesis chapter&nbsp;15&nbsp;verse&nbsp;17&nbsp;says:** _And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces._

**Genesis chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;6-13&nbsp;says:**_&nbsp;And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.&nbsp;And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God amongst the trees of the garden. And the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? &nbsp;And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, the woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, the serpent beguiled me, and I did eat._

**_Genesis chapter 3 verses&nbsp;21&nbsp;says:_**_&nbsp;Unto Adam also and to his wife did the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;God make coats of skins, and clothed them._

**_Deuteronomy&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;21&nbsp;verses&nbsp;18-23&nbsp;says,&nbsp;_**_Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. &nbsp;And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. &nbsp;And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:&nbsp;Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son&#8217;s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned._

_KJV, NKJV)._
