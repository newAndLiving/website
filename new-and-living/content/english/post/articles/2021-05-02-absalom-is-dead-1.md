  Absalom is dead
</h1>

### Texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12.

Let me begin by pointing your attention to the name ‘Absalom’. It is interesting to note here that the name Absalom means, _‘The father of Peace’_. But sadly, you will discover that his lifestyle was a complete contrast to the true meaning of his name. Then what bothers me is the fact that how can the ‘father of peace’ suddenly become the ‘father of intrigues and evil schemes?

Absalom was the third son of David, the king of Israel. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (2Sam.3:3; 14:25). He was therefore a prince from both parent’s lineage. He was the most handsome man in the kingdom at that time. But because of his unruly and disobedient lifestyle, he was killed in the Battle of Ephraim Woods.

As I write this article, I discovered that both Absalom&#8217;s description and rebellious lifestyles remind me of exactly that of Lucifer, who later became the Devil. The Bible initially described him as **_‘… O Lucifer, son of the morning! How thou cut down to the ground, which didst weakens the nations! For thou, hast said in thine heart, &#8220;I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.” (Isaiah 14:12-14)._**

From the quoted scripture above, I noted the root of Lucifer&#8217;s sudden fall from the presence of the Most High God to the depths of the pit. The Bible says, **_‘for thou hast said in thine heart…_**’. Furthermore, as I carefully searched the scripture, I discovered that the root of both Absalom and Lucifer&#8217;s fall from grace to grass was the sin of &#8216;**PRIDE**’. No wonder the Proverbs said, ‘**_Pride goes before destruction; and a haughty spirit before a fall.’ and ‘For as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he:’_** Friend, I just wonder what is the condition of your heart as you read this article? Is it pure or impure? Evil or godly? Carnal or eternal?

Secondly, I also noted that both of them had personal attractiveness, they were unruly and both ended their positions under tragic circumstances that were worse than death.  And not only that, both in their rebellion drew along with them innocent beings unto eternal doom and death (they both led a rebellion against their head. Lucifer led a rebellion against the Lord. While Absalom led a rebellion against David, the father, and King of Israel. They both had eyes for the throne. They both desired to be in control at whatever the cost may be. Friend, I am patiently tracing something and I pray that the Spirit of God will illuminate your inner eyes in Jesus’ name.

Thirdly, they both trusted those who will adulate or worship their rebellion and strong desire for self-seeking glory. They both love to deflect God’s glory to themselves. Perhaps, you are fresh in the ministry, or God is called you into divine labour, please never try to touch, take or share God&#8217;s glory or praise. For the day you dare attempt to take His glory, His presence will depart from you. All they wanted was the crown and the throne. They both had an uncontrollable appetite for power and popularity. And were ready to demand it at whatever cost. Even the death of innocent souls. But, you will see that even after the death of Absalom David did not hastily or forcefully push for his return to the throne. He rather humbly left the matter into the hands of the Lord to perfect it. This, I counsel here must be your attitude as a child of God.

Fourthly, it is instructive to mention that God is supreme and pre-eminent. And right from the Garden of Eden, through the pages of the Bible, the kingdom of darkness is always in contention for control and power. There seems to be a continuous challenge against the sovereignty of God. Satan and his cohorts are constantly in a serious battle against the Kingdom of light. And God be praised for He alone reigns supreme over the heaven and the earth.

Now, the picture of Absalom was first quietly mentioned 2Sam.13:1, 20-29. And his seemingly passive response to the rape of his sister Tamar indicated being kind and gentlemanly. For he said to the sister, **_&#8216;Well my sister, keep quiet for now since he&#8217;s your brother. Don’t, worry about it_**.’ But silently in his heart, he detested Amnon. For the Bible says that &#8216;**_for Absalom hated Amnon…’_**. (v22). No wonder the saying that, _‘the name the parent will give the child is only known to them’._ However, what gives me concern is the blind and weak response of King David to the matter. Although he was wroth when he heard about the rape incident but he did not judge the evil act of rape and incest. What sort of a father will turn a blind eye to such abomination? Rather he did not discipline his son Amnon for he loved him being the firstborn and the supposed heir to the throne.

As I trace this whole chronicle, I observed that another possibility was that as an adulterer himself (see 2Sam.11:1-12:24), David considered himself in no rightful position to punish his own son’s sexual sin. Another possibility is that David thought this was God’s _“an eye for an eye”_ punishment or consequence for his own sexual indiscretion and the tragic death of Uriah, Bathsheba’s husband. (2Sam.12:9-12).

So, what I can see is that although God has forgiven David for his sin of adultery and his hand in the death of Uriah, he was nonetheless not spared from the consequences of his sins. Friend, you have to bear in mind that though God, is loving and faithful, he is equally just and disciplined God. For no sinner will go unpunished. The terminal and strictest judgment of sin is death. Paul said in Romans 6:23, **_&#8216;the wages of sin is death_**. Please note that this refers to both physical and spiritual death.

There is only one thing that separates, hides, and keeps God&#8217;s face away from any man. That thing is non-other than &#8216;SIN&#8217;. Beloved, no matter how little or seemingly harmless is your sin, please note that God can neither condone nor wink at it! Whether yours is a white lie, or exaggeration of a matter, whether it is pornography or masturbation, perhaps yours is stealing of your employer’s time, adultery -sex outside marriage, one thing is certain, sin is sin, small or big, hidden or open. Remember, that your sin will find you out. (Num.32:23).

Friend, the actual picture I intend to present to you here is the intrinsic nature of the kind of life that Absalom carried. I would have you know that although the consequence of his father, David’s sin with Bathsheba and subsequently the death of Uriah, has a significant reason for all his rebellion and disobedience, he was nevertheless dominated and controlled by the sinful nature hence he thought to do evil in his heart-to kill Amnon, his half-brother who raped the sister Tamar in revenge. The scripture says in James 1:20 that, ‘**_For the anger of a man does not work the righteousness of God.’_** Human anger like that of Absalom does not by any means produce or reflect the desires and purposes of God. For vengeance is God&#8217;s and not Absalom. Even if the father, David failed to judge the sin, it is not in the moral and spiritual standing of Absalom to murder another man. No wonder his vengeful action escalated the situation beyond redemption because infliction of injury or like on any other person does not put any man right with God. It is the Gospel (Christ in you) that changes a man. (Rom.1:16-17)

You must understand that God in His plan wanted man to bear about the life-light to keep the darkness at bay. He created mankind so that we can shine the life light and establish His Kingdom&#8217;s purpose here on earth. Mankind was to carry God&#8217;s life-light inside this container called body. Man is only a container and God inside man, is the content only. The Lord’s original concept of ministry has not changed (Phil. 2:13). It is Christ in you and me that is the life-light and the true representative of God on earth. But there is also a representative of the prince of darkness who is much around looking for preys to terminate the life-light. Please note that the body has never been the problem but the species of life the man carries inside.

The original plan of God is for man to exercise dominion by shinning the life-light about. But something tragic happened in the Garden of Eden when the woman and the husband were deceived by the devil to take the fruit from the forbidden tree. (2Cor.11:3). So, after Adam and Eve fell, man lost the glory inside of him (Rom3:23). Even though he still carries about the same body but the life-light has automatically departed the man God originally formed. Mankind became another man so to say, even though he did not physically fall and die, but suffered spiritual death, i.e., (corruption) occurred to his soul-mind, will and emotion. This death terminated the life-light and quietly introduced what the bible called The Old Man.
