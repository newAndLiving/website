### How God Condemn Sin the Flesh

In this section, discuss in detail how God condemned sin in the flesh? Check whether these**&nbsp;few scriptures can assist in your group discussion.**

<ol type="i">

    <strong>Hebrews&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;10&nbsp;verse&nbsp;5-10&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</strong><em>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: &nbsp;In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. &nbsp;By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</em>

    <strong>Hebrews chapter 2 verse 9-14 says,&nbsp;‘</strong><em>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. &nbsp;For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. &nbsp;And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. &nbsp;Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.</em>
  </li>

    <strong>Hebrews chapter&nbsp;9&nbsp;verses 11-15&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; &nbsp;Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. &nbsp;For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? &nbsp;And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</em>
  </li>

    <strong>2 Corinthians chapter&nbsp;5&nbsp;verse&nbsp;21&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</strong><em>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>Galatians chapter 5 verse 24&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>And they that are Christ&#8217;s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Isaiah chapter 53&nbsp;verse&nbsp;5-6&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</strong><em>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed &nbsp;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hath laid on him the iniquity of us all</em>

#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things to know

**<u>Galatians chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;13-14&nbsp;says:&nbsp;“</u>****_Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith”. (NKJV)._**

This is the second Scripture we shall examine to verify if actually Christ has dealt permanently with the flesh. It is my prayer that the Holy Spirit will illuminate your hearts to the completed work of our redemption. This must be settled in your mind as we continue in this study of the&nbsp;Mystery of the Gospel. It must be a personal revelation&nbsp;with a heart that is sincere before God.

**John&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;9&nbsp;verse&nbsp;34-38&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_They answered and said unto him, thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.&nbsp;(_**_KJV)_**

To attempt this discussion let us first define “**what is the curse of the law”**? According to**&nbsp;Galatians chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verses&nbsp;10-11&nbsp;says:**&nbsp;_For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.&nbsp;(KJV)_

What we must understand here is that the curse is not the Law. But the punishment or penalty imposed on breaking the Law. The Book of the Law means the covenant laws that God gave to Moses in the Old Testament.

As good as the Law is, you cannot make yourself right with God by keeping a set of laws. To attempt to do such is to cut off from Christ. It means you have fallen from grace to disgrace. Rather, you must live by the Spirit of God through faith in the righteousness that God has promised us. You must place your faith in Christ Jesus. The main reason for the Law is two-fold;&nbsp;**_<u>to point out our sins to us and to sign post us to the Saviour-Jesus Christ.</u>_**

There were over 700 laws that the Jews were to keep and must not break anyone. However, where a person believes he can live by the Law now breaks it, he is under condemnation of the Law, i.e. Punishment.&nbsp;**_It is this punishment or penalty that is called the curse of the Law_**. Let us know that no man can achieve Salvation through strict observance of the Law. If it were so, then Christ came and died in vain. Then, it means our righteousness is of the Law and not of the&nbsp;promise by Faith. But the good news (The Mystery of the Gospel) is that Jesus Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming the curse of the Law for mankind on the tree at Calvary (we shall study this in detail).&nbsp;**_(Galatians chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;13&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: KJV_

The curse (punishment, liability, exposure, grief, sorrow, pain, sickness etc.) He bore for us in His own body by Himself on the Cross is death.&nbsp;(**_1 Peter chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;24&nbsp;says,&nbsp;_**_who his own self bares our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.&nbsp;(KJV)_

No one can be made perfect through the Law. It is a complete effort in futility. For a man to attempt to do so breeds pride, and the end of pride is a curse called destruction. So, it is through our faith in Christ Jesus death, burial and resurrection according to the scriptures that we are saved from the curse of the Law (flesh).

**_(Ephesians chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verses&nbsp;8-10&nbsp;says,&nbsp;_**_for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. &nbsp;For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them._

_KJV,)._

**_Further Texts:_**

“**_whom God set forth&nbsp;as&nbsp;a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His Forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus”. (Romans chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verses&nbsp;25-26) NKJV_**

The curse of the Law fell on Jesus Christ who was the perfect sacrifice, acceptable substitute. So that, through His obedience unto death, we might become the righteousness of God**.&nbsp;**This is what Christ took upon Himself for mankind in order to save us from eternal death and sin.

#### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things to know

**<u>Scriptural Examples of traditional/religious opposition to Jesus power heal and to forgive sins</u>**

**<u>a)&nbsp;Jews and the Sabbath: &#8211;</u>****_&nbsp;John 5-chapter verse&nbsp;1-16&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. &nbsp;Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. &nbsp;When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, wilt thou be made whole? The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. &nbsp;The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, it is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. &nbsp;He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, take up thy bed, and walk. &nbsp;Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed, and walk. &nbsp;And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. &nbsp;Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. &nbsp;The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. &nbsp;And therefore, did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.&nbsp;(_**_KJV)_**

**<u>b)&nbsp;Opposition from religious leaders</u>****_. John&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;9&nbsp;verses&nbsp;1-5&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? &nbsp;Jesus answered, neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world._

**_John chapter 9 verse&nbsp;8-12 say:&nbsp;_**&nbsp;_The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, this is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. &nbsp;Therefore, said they unto him, how were thine eyes opened? &nbsp;He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.&nbsp; Then said they unto him, where is he? He said, I know not._

**_John chapter 9 verse&nbsp;13-18&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. &nbsp;Then again, the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. &nbsp;Therefore, said some of the Pharisees, this man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. &nbsp;They say unto the blind man again, what sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. &nbsp;But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight._

**_John chapter 9 verse&nbsp;19-38&nbsp;says:_**_&nbsp;And they asked them, saying, is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now sees? His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: &nbsp;But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore, said his parents, He is of age; ask him. &nbsp;Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. &nbsp;He answered and said, whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. &nbsp;Then said they to him again, what did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? &nbsp;He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? &nbsp;Then they reviled him, and said, thou art his disciple; but we are Moses&#8217; disciples. &nbsp;We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. The man answered and said unto them, why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. &nbsp;Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. &nbsp;If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. &nbsp;They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. &nbsp;Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? &nbsp;He answered and said, who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? &nbsp;And Jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. &nbsp;And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.&nbsp;(KJV)._
