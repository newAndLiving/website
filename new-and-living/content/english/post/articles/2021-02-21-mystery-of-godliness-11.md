<u>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?” (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)</u>

_Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. **<u>Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?</u>**” (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)_

  1. The first issue in this quoted text is Peter’s weapon of defence. This to me is very significant for our lesson. Discuss the significance of Peter’s sword. What kind of sword are you still trusting in? Is your sword financial principle, economic or religious principle? Watch out you might be trusting in your own strength like Peter, yet you are a Christian or disciple.
  2. The next critical question is; what cup was JESUS referring to here? What was in this cup? Why was this cup presented to Him, and not others in the Garden of Gethsemane? Why was He so particular in drinking this cup? Why was it necessary for Him to drink it? This is a big mystery!

To briefly explain this, let us first examine Hebrew 10:5 account;

Therefore, when he cometh into the world, he said, **_<u>“Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for me.</u>_**

This verse indicates the complete obedience of CHRIST&#8217;s Priesthood and His faithful sacrifice on the Cross. He was speaking about His willingness to yield His body for us on the Cross as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. And how can these things be except He has a body in our likeness &#8211; be willing, be living and be holy? Though, the body is a container, there must not be a vacuum. Therefore, it was necessary that it must be filled with a **_<u>“certain content”</u>_** as it were. But, how would this content enter the prepared and pre-ordained body of JESUS? This is another Mystery!

So, as touching the mystery of the cup, His complete obedience to willingly yield His body informs us that the sinful nature needs to be dealt with in this same body like ours. That is why Isa. 53:4-6 says, &#8220;**<u>He was wounded for our transgressions&#8230; He was bruised for our iniquities…</u>**&#8221; And what does this mean?

To answer this and other questions mentioned in this section above, let us look at The Living Bible (TLB) rendition of 2 Cor. 5:21**_ <u>&#8211; &#8220;For GOD took the sinless Christ and poured into him our ‘sins’. Then, in exchange, he poured GOD’s goodness into us</u>!<sup>&#8221;                                                                                                                               </sup>_**

From the three scriptures above, it seems GOD took the cup while JESUS was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, stood before Him and presented to Him the ‘cup.’ What was this cup? It was the cup of **_‘our sins’ &#8211;_** my iniquities and your iniquities. It was the cup of our sinful works &#8211; of my lies, your pride, my jealousy, your anger etc.

**IT WAS THE CUP OF GOD’S FURY AND UNDILUTED WRATH** that we all deserve because of our sins and disobedience. This cup signifies that His death was the portion given to him by GOD; the portion He took to redeem sinners (you and I) unto GOD. For us all, JESUS willingly drank this content of this cup and was baptised with this baptism of death. **_It was the cup of judgment against the soul that sinneth_**. And having presented it to him (as the perfect sacrifice), JESUS took the cup and drank it. He did not need to drink the cup of each of us one by one. This is because it is the same Old Man &#8211; Adamic nature &#8211; producing different iniquities in each of us (Rom.5:15-18).

So, GOD in His infinite wisdom needed just one right person, and an acceptable living, willing sacrifice to bear in His body the griefs, sorrows and particularly the judgment and the wrath of us all &#8211; Isa. 53:6. Inside that mysterious cup presented to JESUS to drink was **my** **old man** and **your old man**. This is the Adamic nature that is jealousy in A; anger in B; lying in C and pride in D. Then, CHRIST swallowed the whole content of the cup. At this point, JESUS was already sorrowful and drenched as with sweat drops of blood. Thus, when He swallowed the whole content of the cup, He became an embodiment of our sins as it were, so that we might condemn sin in the body physically on the Cross. This is the reason JESUS came. It is the summit of the Gospel. This is the mystery of our deliverance from Mr. Flesh. To take away the curse of our sins. JESUS came purposely to execute GOD&#8217;s will. **_Then, said he, Lo, I come to do thy will  O, GOD. He taketh away the first Adam, that He may establish the second. By the which we are sanctified &#8216;<u>through</u>’ the offering (DEATH) of the body of JESUS Christ once and for all”_ &#8211; Hebrews 10: 9-10 KJV.** 

“_Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree&#8230;” Gal.3:13_

He did this so that we might be saved from the curse of sin and the world system, and from the wrath and fury of GOD’s judgment for our sins. Equally, at this point, GOD’s will become accomplished! (Luke. 22:42; John. 12:27). What was troubling the Adamic race was **FINISHED**, before JESUS finally gave up His spirit into the hands of GOD. He painfully waited for the Adamic sinful nature &#8211; Mr. Flesh to die, before He bowed His head committing His spirit to the Lord.

This means that the price of sin is DEATH. And you must completely hand over the old man in your life to the Lord at the Cross. Your whole spirit, soul and body must be yielded voluntarily to GOD for the evacuation and termination of the Adamic sinful nature before GOD can generously pour His Spirit into you in exchange. And only a dead man is freed from the curse sin. You cannot carry any curse into the presence of God. It was this huge price that CHRIST paid for you and me on the Cross at Calvary. Are you willing to do the same for Him? This must be settled here before your life can be wholly, living and pleasing vessel unto GOD. JESUS did this, so that, we don’t have to be offering any useless sacrifice to be freed from our sins. In addition, so that we don&#8217;t have to physically die to be freed from the tyranny of sin in the flesh. JESUS did it once and for all. (Heb. 9:26,29; 2Pet.3:9). Halleluiah!

**WHAT HAS CHRIST DEATH ACCOMPLISHED FOR YOU?**

  * Through His death on the Cross, JESUS terminated the Adamic nature. (Rom. 6:6).
  * When CHRIST died on the Cross, Satan’s power of death was broken forever. (Heb. 2:14-15).
  * Through His death on the Cross, CHRIST destroyed the works of the devil. (1 John 3:8b)
  * When CHRIST died on the Cross, Satan’s head was crushed. (Gen. 3:15)
  * When He died on the Cross, the devil’s captives were released. (Luke 4:18)
  * When CHRIST died on the Cross, the principalities and powers, rulers of darkness, demons were disarmed, dislodged, discomfited. (Col. 2:15)
  * As a result of the Cross, Satan’s doom is now guaranteed. (John 12:31, John 16:11; Rev. 20:10)
  * When CHRIST died on the Cross, our old man died with Him; so that we should no longer serve sin and Satan. (Rom.6:6).
  * When CHRIST died on the Cross, He terminated the un-holy relationship, control and dominion we had with our former &#8216;husband&#8217; &#8211; the old man. Since death is the cessation of any marriage, CHRIST&#8217;s death secured our freedom &#8211; Rom. 7:1-4.
