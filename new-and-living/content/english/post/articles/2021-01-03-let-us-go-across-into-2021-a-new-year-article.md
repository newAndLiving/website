  “Let us Go Across into 2021”(Mk 4:35 – 5:1)
</h1>

“And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, let us **pass over** unto the other side.” &#8211; Mark 4:35 (KJV)

**I welcome you all into the New Year 2021 in the name of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I am glad to write this new year welcome message for this new and living way.**

**As we begin this year 2021, I see a great opportunity to reflect on the major lessons learnt last year 2020. This New Year is one that you must bear in mind that life cannot return suddenly to normal as usual. You must be prepared for the ‘New Normal’. This is because the earth has begun her journey to the end!**

**_For, “If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men (and covid-19) rose up against us, then they (it) would have swallowed us alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; but our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth”. (Psalms 124:2-3,8)_**

**What an amazing grace of God that saw us through the unprecedented challenges in 2020. A year characterized with uncertainties, anxieties, untimely deaths, financial crisis, insecurities, fears, terrible covid-19 pandemic and its debilitating effects, but we praise the name of the Lord, that there is still real hope as we have crossed over into 2021.**

In Mk 4:35, I saw Jesus telling the disciples that their time on this side is done and it is time for them to cross over unto the other side. I see year 2021 as year of expansion, enlargement and increase. It will be a year of transitioning and moving into the next position that Heaven has for you. A year of going across to the side of the Lord.  A year of drawing closer to the Lord in every aspect of your life.

There will be a passing over this year and you need to get ready for it. Heaven will be moving you into your next position inside Christ and His word. And you will agree with me that it is thus, imperative that you should no longer be complacent in this New Year. No more room for complacency and compromise. You must now walk daily in one accord with the Lord, who is our **PASSOVER LAMB!**

**_It is a passing over from slavery to sin, from sinful pleasures and carnality into the side of godliness, holiness and righteousness. And the divine means of Passover is the CROSS. For without an encounter with the Cross, the Blood of the Paschal Lamb and the Man of Calvary, there is no genuine Passover. This pass over is a going over into deliverance, great expansion, enlargement increase. Please note that we have passed over into the realm of the Unstoppable move of Jehovah._**

In fact, **whenever God is talking about a going over, it usually begins with a quiet and growing dissatisfaction about one’s current position and the need to move over to the right side.** As you start to experience this in the New Year, count it not strange nor be careless or casual about it. Instead, you would need to cultivate it, feed it and watch it grow. (This is briefly discussed below as you read on). The Year 2021, is a year that as you cross over that the prophetic words will find their fulfilment. Let me quickly ask, have you crossed over yet? Or you are still vacillating?

So, as the world system is preparing for the arrival of the anti-christ, we the children of God must go over the Lord side and await His glorious appearing and second coming. We must be watchful, prayerful, faithful, grateful as we cross over to the New Year.

_ What would be the characteristics of this Passover? What will be your own part in it?_

**1. There will be the sending away of the multitude – vs 36a**

Not everyone will understand or be part of this passing over. While it is good to discuss it and be comfortable with the multitude, one characteristics of this Passover is that **you will have to let go of the multitude** **and cling on** **_the beatitudes_**. The multitude must not hinder or delay your following of Jesus: you will need to follow Jesus even if alone.  Your following Jesus must be deliberate, intimate and personal. You will also have to let go off the multitude in your use of time, resources, privilege etc. You must cast off the restraint of multitudes of time wasters like unnecessary phone calls, worthless conversations, chats, hypocrisy, and fables. You need to cast them off so that you can travel light on the Calvary Road in the New Year 2021.

**2. There will be the deliberate entering into ship(s) – vs 36b**

After the disciples have sent away the multitude, they entered into the ship with Jesus and there were also other ships with Him. Likewise, for this Passover, **you will need to deliberately enter with Jesus into the ‘ship(s)’ that will convey you unto the other side.** You will need to be deliberate and particular about it, without distraction, without sentiment, without entertainment. You will need to enter into the ‘ship(s)’ with Him. These ‘ship(s)’ are the ship of &#8216;DiscipleSHIP&#8217;; of &#8216;FellowSHIP&#8217;; of &#8216;RelationSHIP&#8217;; of strategic and profitable &#8216;FriendSHIP&#8217; or &#8216;CompanionSHIP&#8217; with godly like minds. That is, those who will sharpen you and convey you to the other side together with the Master.

You will need to take your discipleship serious; give much attention and focus with your fellowship with the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit and with the brethren; build and maintain profitable relationship and make friend of the Word of God and life-building materials.

**3. There will be storms/waves which will come to test and build your faith (vs 37 – 41)**

It is absolutely clear that the devil is never happy with New beginnings. He is our adversary all the time. He never gives up. He is the enemy of going forward. He is always looking for whom to devour. He is unruly, stubborn and rebellious. Imagine, that after the multitude of distractions were sent away and they entered the boats, that the storm came up! Can you imagine that?

One thing that usually accompanies passing over/transition are trials, tests, troubles, unbelief, doubts, loneliness, that will come to prove and build your faith (vs 37). The children of Israel had their share of these trials/challenges on their Passover into the Promised Land. Unfortunately, they repeatedly failed these trials and unnecessarily prolonged and postponed their entry into the Promised Land. May you not fail in your time of test and trials in Jesus name. May grace and truth of God attend to you all through the storms of life in Jesus name.

Likewise, **you will need to prepare for storms and challenges that will come your way** as if to sink your ship and drown you in the waters of this world. You are reading this message because the Lord did not permit the covid-19 storms and its catastrophic effects to subdue you last year. Hence, the necessity to stay on the Lord’s side (to stay in the same …SHIP with Jesus.

Be rest assured that storms will certainly come, ferociously and threatening you. However, your perspective is important at this point. You must stay positive and attentive, because they have only come to stretch, sharpen your horizon, fortify your inner strength and prepare your faith for what lies ahead of you on the other side. As such, when they come, **never doubt the presence of Jesus with you nor question His care and compassion for you** (vs 38). Instead, **exercise your faith and put it to use**; instead look unto Jesus, the Master over storms and wind. No matter how little you feel your faith is; that faith is just enough to take you out to safety. In the name of Jesus, speak to the wind, the wave and they will hear you (vs39).

You must refuse to be afraid. And put on your shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. If you obey all these instructions, you will be surprised with the great results that will locate you. (vs 41).

**Friends, this year 2021 will be a year of passing over/transitioning into what God has planned for you. There will be a moving over from where you are now to where He has pre-ordained for you.** 

**It is a year of maximizing divine opportunities. It is a year of maximizing the purging of the Church of God. It is a year of returning of the prodigal sons and daughters into the Church. A year of breaking denominational barriers in the Body of Christ. It is a year of divine outburst, so we must all press on towards the path of righteousness for his name sake. It is a year of unstoppable move of the power and purpose of God. It is a season of divine multiplication (fruitfulness) that will remain. It is a season of divine presence. It is also a year of parallel events happening in the world and in the Church. So, we the Church must stay focus on God side.** 

Therefore, I welcome you into a new chapter Year 2021 (Mk 5:1). A new chapter with a new identity and testimony.

In conclusion, let us briefly look again at the key words in Mk 4:35b:

“… **Let** **us** **pass over** unto **the other side**.” &#8211; Mark 4:35 (KJV)

  * **Let**: A call to action; a call to allow, permit; an imperative command in the first or third person.
  * **Us**: You will not be alone in this journey. It is US &#8211; Christ and you. He promised to be with you on this journey to the other side. He will not leave you alone.
  * **Pass over**: This year will be a year of passing over, transitioning, into what God has in plan for you next. A year of movement; of crossing over. It means deliverance from bondage to freedom in order to worship the Lord in spirit and truth.
  * **The other side**: Not this side but the other side. Not the side you are now but the other side across the sea. Not your current position but where God wants you to be next.

**PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTS TO FOLLOWING JESUS TO THE OTHER SIDE.**

Below, are few practical means of seeking the Lord and growing in Him through your peculiar kind of …SHIP.

  1. **THE WORD OF GOD**-It is through God’s word that you can seek to know Him better now that you have crossed over to the other side-2021. It is God’s word that testifies about Him. (Heb.11:3; 2Tim.3:16-17; Jh 5:39; 2Cor.3:18; 2Pet 1:3-4). For your inheritance at the other side is packaged in the Word of God that has transited you to the New side. E.g., Abraham Gen12:1-3; Jesus Luke 4:17-19, Mary Luke 1:26-38. Nothing else but the Word of God.
  2. **PRAYER**&#8211; Exo 31:18; Luke 11:1-11; Isaiah 26:3, Phil 4:6-7, Luke 6:12-13; Eph. 6:18
  3. **FASTING**-To abstain from food or other pleasures for a period of time for Kingdom Purpose. See Dan 9:2-3; 10:3. (Fasting must not be done arbitrarily or as a self-imposed religious exercise but as led by the Lord with Prayer, Praise and worship.
  4. **PRACTICAL OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD**. This is another key implement to cultivating, irrigating and fertilizing your spiritual life in the New Year. E.g., Heb 3:17-18, 5:7-8; Gen.12:1-4; Isa. 1:19 etc
  5. **FellowSHIP with the other belivers**-Heb.10:24-25; Eph. 2:18-19; Psa. 133:1-3.
  6. **DiscipleSHIP:** &#8211; This you would agree with me is yet a **very crucial means** of growing in the New year with the Lord. It is an important secret implement to obtaining the hidden treasures of the Kingdom of God. See Gen. 2:8; Gal. 4:1-4; 1 Sam. 3:1-11: Acts 6:1-3; Mk. 3:13-15; Matt.5:1-2 etc.

In Conclusion, for you not to stagnate in the New year, you MUST desire to pursue the knowledge of the Lord and have Him as your eternal portion. You MUST pay a very close attention to God’s means of achieving His own purpose in all your endeavours.

I strongly believe that each of these practical means have already followed you into the New Year in great dimension in knowing God, if only you would apply yourself to them with all diligence, determination and devotion.

**<u>PRAYERS</u>**

As you have passed over to the other side in the Lord, may new things spring up for you. May the passing over not be a constraint and a restraint in Jesus name. But an enlargement and an expansion to the Kingdom of God wherever you are posted.

I pray that, as you cross over, you will not stagnate but integrate into a fresh altitude with the right attitude (Gal. 5:22-23).

In this day of Unstoppable move of God, may you be unstoppable in all your undertakings in Jesus name. Amen**_._**

**Happy New Year!**
