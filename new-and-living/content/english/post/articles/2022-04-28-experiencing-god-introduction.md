  <strong>&#8220;&#8230;EXPERIENCING GOD&#8230;&#8221;</strong>
</h1>

### **Anchor Text**: Luke 19:1-10**.**

Dear friends, in this series of life application studies on the life of Zacchaeus-the Chief Tax Collector, we shall be exploring the gateway into Experiencing God. Several characters in the Bible could not have been able to share their life experience with us if they did not encounter the Lord. At different times, places, and circumstances, they came into unscheduled collision with God before He became the sole precedence in their life. The counteraction they came against with God became their platform of accomplishment in life. Perhaps, your own life will encounter the Rock of Ages as you read this. And may the Lord grant clear and bright illumination to your heart in every aspect in Jesus&#8217; name.

I have had several trials and tests, either directly or personally. God cannot spare you from these encounters if you want your precious life to amount to anything in the hands of the Lord.

Genuine experience affects the judgment or feelings produced by any event. These events may be either witnessed or participated in everyday life. My motivation, however, in this write up is to focus on the careful process of divine encounter and its implication on a man&#8217;s life.

It is not a random occurrence for a person to experience the Lord. But a direct and definite one with a clear beginning (place) and enduring progress. Given this, a child of God cannot affirm a concrete encounter without an open meeting, which means no encounter, no experience!

A divine encounter is direct contact with God. So, when a child of God has a forceful collision with God, they experience a complete loss or change of their opinion, standard, ideology and direction. Do you have a testimony to this effect?

Most men who encounter God experience a violent encounter. You will agree that none of us was born a friend of God. The Bible says, &#8216;…_While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&#8217; Rom 5:8_. So, an encounter is a counteraction and not a parallel action. Two parallel lines cannot meet. Given this, for a genuine child of God, a constant counteraction with God is an everyday experience for spiritual maturity and stability.

As we take a quick look at the narrative about Zacchaeus in **Luke 19:1-10**, it is my prayer that you will encounter the Lord and experience a lasting counteraction against anything in your life contrary to the Lord in Jesus&#8217; name.

The first intricate matter of note in this short narrative about Zacchaeus is that _&#8216;Life&#8217; is a journey_. We set about on various trips and plans in our daily living, arranged multiple meetings, and set out for one business or the other. However, in the course of all these, we experience unplanned counteraction. Such incidental actions set us in collision with the Lord! And the outcome of this encounter with the Lord will either permanently bless us or permanently damage us.

A few years ago, I set about on a holiday journey to the US. I took along a particular book to read on the flight. The book was titled, _&#8216;When the Heavens are closed&#8217;_. As I started with the introduction, I could not stop but read on. I could barely eat something before I got to my destination. The holiday was for two weeks visiting three different states, but friends, I couldn&#8217;t even go past the spare room my cousin lodged me. My two weeks holiday turned into a personal retreat. My host could not comprehend why I refused to visit places and friends.

During my time in my cousin&#8217;s house, I uniquely experienced the Lord. Bear in mind that I did not plan for a retreat at all. The supposedly planned holiday visit turned out to be a counteraction against my will, way, and plan. In this default retreat, I experienced God in an extraordinary way beyond my expectation. Indeed, an encounter of a lifetime. It was a forceful collision with my own will and plan. It collided with my desired schedule such that I experienced a permanent destiny transformation. This lifetime change is now a blessing to me.

Friends, this is the kind of encounter I am discussing with you—a lifetime counteraction against everything that is not wholly pleasing and acceptable unto the Lord.

You will agree with me that Zacchaeus was about his business when he suddenly met a huge crowd surrounding Jesus. And this became a sort of wonder and attraction to him. Hence, he could not wait for the vast group because he was of short stature. So, by instinct, he ran before and quickly climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Christ, for He was passing through that way.

Although Zacchaeus was rich, very popular, and was the chief among the tax collectors, he still had a need. He was not complete without an encounter with the Lord. Zacchaeus&#8217;s life was empty. His ways were not acceptable to the Lord. He knew in his own heart that there was an emptiness and unrest. Imagine such a wealthy man, yet heavy laden and full of trouble. So, my friend, as you read this, let me ask you what the condition of your life is? Complete or incomplete? Are you confused or at peace? Can you boldly say you have experienced the Lord Jesus as your personal Lord and Saviour? Can you point to a spiritual encounter with Him? For where there is no encounter, there can be no experience. No cross, no glory. No scar, no star!

Shalom.

Every Blessing in Christ.
