#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection (Section Title):

Let me welcome you to this blog with prayer **“… that the LORD will bless and keep you; He will quicken and enlighten the eyes of your inner man with His light from the realm of the wondrous Cross. May grace and truth help you to walk from day to day in the footprints of our Savior JESUS. Amen.”**

<sup>“</sup>All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Mt 11:27 (NIV) John 1:18 (ESV).****

As I read the above verse severally, it became very profound to me, of the infinite, immeasurable and boundless union between the Father and the Son. And for this article, allow me to share few gleanings from this verse with you. That is, the priceless companionship between the Father and the Son-Jesus Christ.

Permit me to let you know that this verse stems out of JESUS’ prayer for the nations (people), who have not repented from their sins, even though He had performed so many miracles. It is certainly a true saying that even miracles do not make a saint, and there is a great lesson for us here. A strong lesson that is very instructive for our daily walk with GOD in this blog.

When JESUS had finished given out instructions to His disciples, He went out to teach and preach through the villages and towns. On getting to this region, the LORD and Saviour performed miracles that confirmed Him as the Messiah and demanded repentance from sins and dead works (verse 20); but never-the-less they were unrepentant. They rejected the Messiah, and this would result in terrible judgment because the evidence of JESUS identity was clear. Permit me at this junction my friend to ask &#8211; **Is JESUS identity and truth very clear to you? Or is it vague? Is your vision about the crucified and glorified CHRIST still blurred or obscured?** This is what happened when you seek after miracles instead of intimate companionship with the Messiah. Miracle blinds the vision; it distorts the truth.

As I have discovered, there is a great danger when men seek only miracles without the Gospel. There is a huge consequence in the pew when the minister focuses on miracles and avoid the message of true repentance. It is like walking blindfolded; it adds salt to injury; it is also like applying bandage on a cancerous wound. Beloved, note that JESUS only did many miracles as a bait, in order to bring them to the knowledge of the truth; so that they do not perish in their sins, but to come to the place of genuine repentance. The problem of mankind is sin and not miracles; and the only comprehensive instrument to deal with the sinful nature is the Cross. The message of the Cross therefore is the Power of GOD unto salvation to everyone that believes; but foolishness to those who are perishing. JESUS is saying here that He does not want them to perish any longer in their sin. No wonder He prayed from verse 25-26.

_At that time Jesus said,_ “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. __Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.__

Friend, is this your case? Has God hidden His word from you? If so, then, you must take heed and stop looking out for miracles but seek after the message of true repentance. **Don’t be a follower of miracle but be a follower of Christ.** ****

Mark 16:17 (KJV) says, “_<u>And these signs (miracles, wonders) shall follow them that believe…”</u>_ It is very clear from this verse, that miracles come after the Good News has been preached. It does not make a saint. Genuine miracle seeks after genuine believers. It looks for them as a mother looks after her suckling child. Our GOD is the GOD of Providence. Because it is the Kingdom right of believers that miracles should look for them, and not them looking after miracles. You see it looks very similar, but there is a huge difference.

So, it was on this premise that JESUS prayed to the Father on behalf of the remnants. This prayer focuses on the remnant at that time, and even in the present generation that despite the popular overall rejection of the Message of the Cross. There are still remnants who faithfully embrace the truth, **follow Jesus and not miracles.******

Indeed, without controversy or argument the Father knows his Son. The Son equally knows his Father.&nbsp;The **‘Son’** being referred to in this verse is quite distinct; even the ‘**Father’** is in caps as well. In my KJV, NLT and NIV translations, it is also with capital letter. And without controversy, the **‘Son’** is no other person, but **CHRIST** and the **‘Father’** is **GOD**. The tone of this statement is as if JESUS was making reference to a third person that He knew. To aptly put it, a COMPANION. However, He was actually making reference to Himself. CHRIST is the Only Begotten Son of GOD. This is very instructive for us.

As I continued my gleanings, I discovered that, there is an intimacy of oneness between the Father and the Son. There is a bond of love and peace between the Father and the Son. Love so deep and vast beyond all measure. Such that the Father could not commit the revelation of himself to anyone else, except His Son &#8211; JESUS CHRIST.

The implication of this to me is that, even though God is Omni-present, yet He only reveals himself through His Son **_<u>to whom He chooses</u>_**. He reveals himself only to those who diligently seek Him. He reveals Himself to those who are His companion in a deep intimacy with His Own Son. He reveals it to those who worship Him in spirit and in truth. To those who carry his DNA. And I am glad to announce that GOD has shed this love in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of love which every genuine believer receives at conversion. The question in my mind is, “Is this love in your heart? Is this love of CHRIST in the Church today? In the family? Would CHRIST, the Love of GOD finds His Spirit of love in our hearts to commit divine task into our hands when He returns?” Remember John 2:24?

_“__But Jesus, for His part, did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all people [and understood the superficiality and fickleness of human nature]”. (_AMP_)_ __

&nbsp;Oh, how I fervently pray that the Lord will stamp skin deep in our hearts His unutterable love in Jesus name. For no human nature (Mr. Flesh) can glory in His presence.

As I continue in my gleaning, I discovered that the Father and the Son have fellowship with each other. An uncommon communion that has developed into a strong inseparable and unbroken companionship between them. And no one can separate them. A relationship that is everlasting and perfect. Such that the Father has confidence in the Son to the extent of committing all things to Him. I mean GOD the Father delivered **all things into the hands of JESUS**! &nbsp;Please, tell me which earthly king or queen can honestly do that and would not withhold few rights and privileges from the son? But we see GOD willingly put all things into the hand of His Son &#8211; who being the brightness of His glory, an express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, after He had by Himself found Him worthy, faithful, obedient and holy. Being made so much better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than them; to the extent that the Son gave up His own will for the Father’s will to be done. (Heb.1:3-4).

Beloved, I just wonder if God can find us faithful to commit souls of men into our hands; to commit His kingdom projects; to commit young virgins, young men, elderly into our hands? What would our relationship with them bring forth? Controversy or condemnation? Will their lives produce fruits meet for repentance and Master’s use? Will they come out of our hands with testimony of His grace and mercy? Would we defile, abuse or damage them? Will they become better or battered? Will they be transformed from the bondage of self, sin and Satan into the Kingdom of light of our LORD JESUS? O, for Thy grace LORD, for a sustainable and dependable intimate companionship with You every day, every hour in Jesus name.

Looking closely at the second phrase from that verse 17 which says _&#8220;&#8230; And nobody knows the Son except the Father._&#8221; It is pertinent to note the word **_&#8216;nobody.&#8217;_** It means no one &#8211; no matter how highly placed; intelligent; connected; influential; wealthy; famous; whether a celebrity or not; be it the poor; the needy; whether you are a professional theologian; whether a pontiff; whether a prayer warrior; you cannot have knowledge of JESUS except by the Father. This is a strong and profound statement, _&#8220;&#8230; And nobody knows the Son except the Father._&#8220;

JESUS is saying that the Father is not partial and is no respecter of anybody. This, to me, is weighty and deep. It gives me much confidence and assurance that it is not by works but by grace. It is not by status or class that anyone can know the Son and the Father, but through the mercy and love of GOD. Hallelujah!

Therefore, let it be known to you that except the Son chooses, nobody can claim to know the Father. In addition, no man of GOD born of a woman, no angel or spirit can reveal either the Father or his Son, except either of them chooses, wills, decides to give any revelation. It means that you cannot induce, cajole, deceive them. You cannot even compel or force them. It also means that you cannot steal the word from them. But for any genuine revelation, it can only be by their own prerogative &#8211; the choice ofboth the Father and the Son. &nbsp;And as companions, nothing is hidden between them. This is the Mystery of the Gospel; that CHRIST JESUS is the Son of God who came into this world of sin in the human flesh from heaven to express the love of the Father to all. He did this by giving his life as a living sacrifice on the Cross to save mankind from sin &#8211; (John 12:23-27). This has been revealed to us by the ministry of the prophets in the Old testament, by the ministry of JESUS in person and the ministry of the apostles by the Holy Spirit. So my friend, let me ask you this crucial question &#8211; do you have a personal revelation of the crucified and glorified CHRIST? Have you personally encountered the divine power of GOD that has given us everything that we need both for life and godliness through the knowledge of CHRIST?&nbsp; Have you seen the Cross and Him crucified and Him glorified? Can you faithfully point to a definite encounter of your assurance of salvation? If not, then you need to be saved. Don’t delay. Take that lifetime decision NOW!

Finally, it is instructive to note here that, you must humble yourself in the presence of the LORD, before the Son can reveal the Father to you. A proud and arrogant man can neither know GOD nor JESUS. The man who has lifted up his soul to sin and self cannot know GOD. GOD is very far away from such self-induced person. For example, when JESUS asked the disciples, “What do men say that I the Son of Man is?” Simon Peter answered and said, _‘Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.’ But Jesus answered, ‘Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona; for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which art in heaven’_ (Matthew 16:15-17 KJV). Truly, as sons and daughters, we must be the true likeness of the Father. But my friend, are you one? Is your lifestyle a true likeness of the kingdom? (See the Beatitudes in Matthew 5-7). Does your life release the true fragrance of the knowledge of the Son of GOD or of the flesh (Mr. Self)?

It took the Father to reveal the Son to Peter. Not even the Scribes, Pharisees or Disciples could know the Son, but by the Spirit of the Father to Peter. Also, it took Judas who had been with the Son of God for three and half years to mark out JESUS with an un-holy kiss before His arrest by the soldiers.

Let me have you know that even if you decide to study the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, you cannot beat or outsmart GOD unless you surrender to His Son; acknowledge Him as Your Personal Lord and Saviour; then, ask Him to fill you with the Holy Spirit. This is a cardinal step in knowing GOD and JESUS, His only Son. “_For no man can know the Father except whomsoever the Son wills to reveal Him”_. Amen.

#### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Way Out:

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Acknowledge that JESUS is the Son of GOD; and that He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. (John 14:6-7)
  </li>
  <li>
    Recognise that GOD has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Him, JESUS. (Matt. 28:18)
  </li>
  <li>
    Let it be known unto you that the Father loves His Son and has committed <strong>ALL</strong> things into His hands. (John 3:35).
  </li>
  <li>
    And that when you believe in your heart, that Jesus is the Lord and Saviour, and by confession in your mouth, you shall be saved. So, be born again. (Rom. 10:9-10)
  </li>
  <li>
    Grow daily in faith by <strong>daily </strong>reading, searching and living out the Word of GOD; for in it you have eternal life. (John 5:39)
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep knowing this, that the Father knows the Son and the Son knows the Father; and JESUS the Son of God gave His sinless life for you as a sacrifice on the Cross. (John 10:15)
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, be a disciple of CHRIST. Jesus has revealed the Father to us, and will continue to do so. By this, His love will be in you daily. (John 17:25-26). This verse gives me so much joy. What about you?
  </li>
</ol>

##### 1.2.1&nbsp; Short Prayer:

Thank You GOD, for Your Holy Word. It is so sweet and pure, such that no flesh can glory in Your presence. Because, if not for You, we cannot know CHRIST. LORD JESUS, we know that GOD uses man to reveal His word, but if You do not help us, our lives and our ways will be dark, slippery and crooked.

LORD JESUS, honestly, we don’t want to continue living in our sins and love our own selves. Baptise us with Your Pure Spirit that we may hate iniquity, pride and disobedience. Give us grace to love You, Your Kingdom and Your righteousness. For how long would we remain a blind guide and a mute messenger, and allow ignorance and arrogance to damage and batter us? So, our blessed Saviour, be Thou forever near us; help us not to wander from the truth any more &#8211; but to follow You duly in true companionship to the end. Give us grace to follow You, our Master and our Friend. Please, strengthen our feeble minds to feel Thee and draw us nearer to Thee. There are many tempting sounds and sights that daze and dazzle us. Nevertheless, draw us nearer to the Cross and shield our soul from self and sin. Finally, Blessed Holy Spirit, thou guardian of our soul, give us a **<u>PERSONAL REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST</u>** in Jesus name we pray. Amen. (Rev. 1:1)
