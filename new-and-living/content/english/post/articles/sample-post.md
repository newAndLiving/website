Dearly Beloved in Christ Jesus, it is with great pleasure I welcome you to the maiden edition of the article section. The good Lord has been gracious unto us to create this medium for us to reach one another in the unity of faith and the bond of one love in Christ Jesus. So, that we can actively share with you our personal experience of the divine blessedness of who Christ is and what He has done and can still do in our lives and in this end time.

The purpose of this article amongst many is to offer you contextual Biblical principles and fresh practical spiritual lessons for daily living. It will afford you the lifetime chance of yielding yourself to daily spiritual disciplinary dealings, godly counselling and instructions for the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. And to prepare you ready for His second coming and glorious appearing.

We hope that it will pilot you, raise timely alarms, offer Christ disciplined way of escape for the one who diligently and faithfully cares to read and practice the golden truth.

The overarching aim is to build up your most faith with heavenly focus by teaching you to become genuine disciple like a householder in Christ who daily brings out of his storehouse treasure, that is the NEW CREATION MAN. (Matthew 13:52).

The article section will majorly centre on inspired and divinely led Biblical principles that our sages imbibed and lived upon as recorded in the scripture. They will be in form of practical study outlines as guide to practical Christian growth. These principles will include Redemption, Justification, sanctification, Repentance from dead works, faith towards God, Godly marital principles, Discipleship, current news and the Church to mention just a few.

We do not intend to develop a theological or academic system of study outline. Our utmost intention and focus will be directed on actual impartation of Christ life on each reader, including the real-life experience of Gods divine purpose. They are not course work but spiritual aid to personal spiritual development. We also believe that as you patiently engage and follow the (article) study outline, your heart and mind will be ignited to seriously desire to know more about God.

This article section is aimed to provide additional insight and a stop gap to the familiar but time-limited church Bible class. It is our hope that it will impact your lives and open you to a broader exposure in a robust manner for your personal discipleship.

The articles may be used for group meetings, fellowship or even ministry purposes freely. You are free to run the Bible study as led by the Holy Spirit. Our prayer is that you will be deliberate and personal in engaging the series of articles. May you have a personal encounter with the Lord as you respond to each publication. May the living truth come to you with grace to respond to every instruction and spiritual dealings from the Lord.

We pray that you will grow in grace with your faith stirred and sharpened in faith to take up responsibility. Please continually pray to endure daily challenges, needs and trials that may come your way both for life and godliness. May you develop a positive spiritual perspective and vigour to stand and withstand them in your personal pilgrimage in Jesus name.

Every fullness of Christ

God bless you.
