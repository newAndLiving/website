#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble

**_What then is a “Mystery”?_**

_A ‘Mystery’ is a profound declaration of deep spiritual truth, as unveiled by God through divine inspiration and not of human ability or intelligence._

_A&nbsp;Mystery is any truth that is unknowable by human training, except by divine revelation._

##### 1.1.1&nbsp; Biblical Definitions:

**_a.}&nbsp;Ephesians&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verses&nbsp;5&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_[This&nbsp;Mystery] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles (consecrated messengers) and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit.&nbsp;_**_(AMPC)_**

**_b.}&nbsp;_****Ephesians&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verses&nbsp;9-10&nbsp;says:&nbsp;****(**_In all His wisdom and insight, God has made known to us the&nbsp;Mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,&nbsp;<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him.&nbsp;__(_**ESV)**

**c.} 1 Corinthians&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;7&nbsp;_says:_** _“__But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages for our glory,&nbsp;**(NKJV)**_

**_d.} Revelation&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;7&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.”&nbsp;**(NKJV)**_

##### 1.1.2&nbsp; COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS:

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    The “how”, “when” and “whom” was&nbsp;prophesied was hidden for a long time. But when the full manifestation of time came, God was manifested to all mankind through Christ Jesus. And it is in the preaching of the Gospel that Christ the Power and&nbsp;Glory of God is revealed-&nbsp;<strong>This is the Mystery of the Gospel. (See John&nbsp;5: 1-20 and&nbsp;John 9: 1-41 NKJV, KJV).</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    There is fullness of time and season to everything under the earth. Even to each of us when we came to Christ. We came to him when it was set by the mercy of God. Who knows whether this is your own time for deliverance?
  </li>
  <li>
    There is no understanding of God apart from a deliberate personal intimate functional relationship with His Son- Jesus Christ.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is ONLY through Jesus we can live and manifest a perfect life and not through any other person, means or object. Not even through our superstitions, sentiments, culture, tradition or religion.
  </li>
  <li>
    In its complete understanding, God has revealed to mankind that, it is through Jesus Christ that we are being saved.
  </li>
  <li>
    The absolute way to eternal life is the unshakable and unwavering faith in Christ suffering, death, burial and resurrection.&nbsp;<em>And neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</em>&nbsp;<em>Acts&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;4 verse&nbsp;12</em>. (KJV)
  </li>
</ol>

**EXCEPT THE NAME OF JESUS!**&nbsp;(We must know that Salvation comes no other way; and no other name has been or will be given to us by which we can be saved, only this one….**&nbsp;JESUS**&nbsp;**CHRIST**!

Let us now closely examine each of this segment of the Mystery of the Gospel.&nbsp;Our central Scriptural guide to this study&nbsp;is 1 Timothy chapter3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;16 “_And without&nbsp;controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory”._

#### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JESUS CAME IN THE FLESH

i.}&nbsp;**_Did Jesus actually come in the flesh_**? To attempt this question, let us look at the account of His genealogy as reported in

**Matthew&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verses&nbsp;16-17&nbsp;says:**_&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.&nbsp;So, all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations._

**Matthew&nbsp;chapter 1 verses&nbsp;18-22&nbsp;says****:&nbsp;**_Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded&nbsp;to put her away privily. &nbsp;But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. &nbsp;And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name&nbsp;Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. &nbsp;Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,_

Cf.&nbsp;**I_saiah&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;11&nbsp;verse&nbsp;1&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_And there shall come forth a&nbsp;Rod out of the&nbsp;Stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of&nbsp;His roots: (NKJV, KJV)._

ii.}&nbsp;**_Jesus Birth_**:&nbsp;**_Luke&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verses&nbsp;26-35&nbsp;says:_**_And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&#8217;s name was Mary.&nbsp;And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.&nbsp;And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.&nbsp;And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. &nbsp;And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name&nbsp;Jesus.&nbsp;He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:&nbsp;And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.&nbsp;Then said Mary unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing I know not a man?&nbsp;And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore, also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.&nbsp;(KJV)_

**_Luke&nbsp;chapter 1 verse&nbsp;42-45&nbsp;says:_****_&nbsp;_**_And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.&nbsp;And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? &nbsp;For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. &nbsp;And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. (NKJV, KJV)_

**Luke&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;6-7&nbsp;says:**_&nbsp;And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers._

**_Luke&nbsp;chapter 2 verses&nbsp;16-19&nbsp;says:_**_&nbsp;And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. &nbsp;And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.&nbsp;But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart._

**_Luke&nbsp;chapter 2 verses&nbsp;25-32&nbsp;says:_****_&nbsp;_**_And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.&nbsp;And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord&#8217;s Christ. &nbsp;And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,&nbsp;Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: &nbsp;For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;&nbsp;A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. &nbsp;And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him. &nbsp;And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary&nbsp;His mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;&nbsp;(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.&nbsp;(KJV)_

**_Luke&nbsp;chapter 2 verse&nbsp;36-40&nbsp;says:_****_&nbsp;_**_And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fasting and prayers night and day. &nbsp;And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of&nbsp;Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. &nbsp;And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. &nbsp;And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon&nbsp;Him. (NKJV, KJV)_

**_Matthew&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;1-2&nbsp;says:_**_&nbsp;Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship&nbsp;Him._

**_Matthew&nbsp;chapter 2 verse 6&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel._

**_Matthew&nbsp;chapter 2 verse&nbsp;11&nbsp;says:_**_&nbsp;And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh. (NKJV, KJV)_

iii**_.}&nbsp;_****_If Christ came in the flesh, then what type of flesh was it? And why is this very important for me to know? Where in the Bible did it say that He came in the flesh?_**

_(a.)&nbsp;“By&nbsp;**this&nbsp;**you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses&nbsp;**that Jesus Christ&nbsp;**has come in the&nbsp;**flesh**&nbsp;is of God …”&nbsp;(1 John&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;4&nbsp;verse&nbsp;2 NKJV)._

_(b) “For many deceivers have gone out into the world&nbsp;**who do not confess Jesus**&nbsp;**Christ**&nbsp;as coming&nbsp;**in the flesh**. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.”&nbsp;(2 John&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verse&nbsp;7 NKJV)._

_(c) “Inasmuch then as the children have&nbsp;**partaken of flesh and blood,&nbsp;**He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,&nbsp;and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” (Hebrews&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;14-15 NKJV)_

_(d) “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, **who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,** but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. (Philippians chapter 2 verse 5-8 NKJV)_
