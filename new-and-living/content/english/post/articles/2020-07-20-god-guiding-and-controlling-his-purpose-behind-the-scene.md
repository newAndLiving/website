### God Guiding and Controlling his Purpose Behind the Scene

#### Gleanings from the book of Esther Chapter 1

Within my reach is a compelling verse in Heb.11:3, ‘**_By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible’._**

The meaning of this verse is that nothing happens by chance or by fluke with God. The Lord has pre-determined and prepared all things even before the preparation of the world. Every event in any dispensation are all preordained by the Lord. And nothing happens without His divine approval. Actually, God rules in the affairs of men.

In addition, as we begin our gleanings on the book of Esther, this delightful verse is telling us that there is an unseen hand moving the scene from behind by His power and might. This unseen hand has continually guided and controlled the destiny of dispensations of time where men and women have existed and still exist. The sovereign Lord is graciously and timely working out behind the scene both to will and to do all things according to his good pleasure.

So, the narrative in the book of Esther will reveal to you the uncompromising faithfulness and righteousness of men and women of faith who searched for God’s purpose, what He had ordained, what He had revealed even though the name of God was not mentioned at all in this book of Esther. The invisible hand of God is surely guiding and controlling the fate of generations, nations and nations of people according to His will and purpose.

Therefore, as we progress in these gleanings of Esther, you will soon discover the blessed faithfulness and integrity of sages. Indeed, God is never very far from the thoughts of a person of faith. A faithful and righteous man or woman is one who has experienced first, a basic revelation of Christ and as he or she presses on, God in His abundant mercy progressively reveals more and more of the Mystery of Godliness unto them. This to me is the central aspect of this gleaning about person and character queen Esther and her uncle Mordecai.

Furthermore, it is only a man or woman with an inner seeing eyes and inner hearing ears that can be a companion of God. I discovered in this narrative that the extent of man’s growth is largely hinged on His intimate knowledge and fellowship with God. May the Lord give you a seeing eyes, hearing ears and perceiving heart as you glean along in this story of queen Esther even in a foreign land.

The timely and active role of Mordecai in this book indicate to me that the Holy Spirit was at work to lend him sight, insight, and foresight into the history annals to passionately save the Jews. He had an unquestionable passion for his beloved people. His unconditional love for his fellow Jews led him to risk even his life before Haman in order to deliver his people from the evil decree of Haman. He certainly saw God in his situation. Such that if Esther failed to boldly risk her influential role, even deliverance will come from another source. This begs the question, what am I using my position as a believer to do in my workplace, family and community? To exploit, harass or bully? Or to glorify God and bless others? Or to legislate the light-life of the kingdom of God? These are issues and many more we will consider in this gleaning.

Finally, we see God using mere man-a gate keeper to do great things. Man, who was nothing. Man, who was base and unpopular was used by God to penetrate the high places as it were for the deliverance of the Jews. What a might God we serve.

**‘_For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,&nbsp;are called:&nbsp;but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;&nbsp;and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen,&nbsp;yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:&nbsp;that no flesh should glory in his presence’_****. (1Cor.1:26-29)******

In conclusion, the Living God in His holy character and nature does not close His holy eyes to the oppressed, poor, and needy in the society. The very true God whom we serve cannot and will not, turn His eyes away from the oppressed and the needy in any community. So, we have seen this unfailing character of GOD right from Genesis in the time of Jacob, while the Israelites were in Egypt. The Bible reveals the divine character of God and His attendant care towards the oppressed as in Ps. 12:5.

**_&#8220;Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise,&#8221; says the Lord, &#8220;I will set him in the safety for which he longs.&#8221; (AMP_**)

**Prov. 22:22-23**

**_Do not rob the poor because he is poor, or crush the oppressed or afflicted at the gate, for the Lord will plead their case, and take the life of those who rob them. (AMP)_**

Beloved, as we glean wisdom and instructions from this practical study in the book of Esther, we shall encounter God&#8217;s unfailing and faithful character. His compassion and care towards the oppressed, the needy, and the poor in the society.

From the scriptures quoted above, one thing is common, that God in His holiness and sovereignty fights for them. Also, we see that God does not close His eyes to them; but watches over them and hears their groaning; sees their affliction and empathizes with them.

The picture that readily comes to mind is that of a suckling child in the hand of a committed and compassionate nursing mother. Hardly will a genuine nursing mother ignore the cry of the suckling child at hand. She goes the extra way to pacify the suckling child and brings the child comfort and peace. This is exactly true of the character of God towards the oppressed and the needy.

Friend, are you presently oppressed or harassed in your home, community, workplace, family, or church? Be patient, for help is on the way. For thus says the Lord, &#8220;_I will not keep silent at this time of need, for through this pen of a writer, relief, deliverance, and righteousness like a river will flow to your hearts, spirit, and soul.&#8221; In Jesus Name. (emphasis mine)._

For a few years past, God has been nudging and prompting me to put this personal, devotional journal into print format. It began with my regular personal devotion called **_&#8216;Alone with God&#8217;_**; pressed with on-going discipleship training and exposure. As a response to these continuous discipleship training and exposures, I went back to the Lord for further confirmation and clarification for the need in times like this?

And one morning, by the strong leading of the Holy Spirit while discussing with my wife and my daughter, a clear impression with confirmation came deeply on my heart. Following this, while listening to a radio programme on BBC Radio 4, an inspiration came to my heart in the right direction to take.

Beloved, I am very confident that God has begun a good thing within you through this gleaning/blog, and will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns. The Scripture says, &#8220;To each person, the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of ALL.&#8221;

Therefore, it is with labour in obedience to God and much prayer, that you are reading this and many more gleanings/blogs. May you be enlightened, liberated, and transformed as you read it with much personal prayer, illumination, and practical application to your life. As you regularly read it with interest and profoundness of heart, may Christ Himself be formed in you as the Hope of Glory. Amen

I welcome you to glean along with me with faith and devotion. God bless you.
