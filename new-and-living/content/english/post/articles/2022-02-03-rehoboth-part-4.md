  <strong>&#8220;&#8230;Rehoboth&#8230;&#8221;</strong>
</h1>

### **Key Text**: **Genesis 26:1-22**

There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.

The correlation between Abraham&#8217;s and Isaac&#8217;s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.

<span data-contrast="auto">Resistance can be God&#8217;s provident and sovereign way of reordering or guiding a man&#8217;s steps in the right direction. The methods of God are past finding out, for no man can know what God does from the beginning to eternity. All that God gives us or makes us know about His plan for our lives are the ones we mature enough to comprehend.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Isaac moved from highbrow quarters in Gerar to the Valley of Gerar to Rehoboth&#8217;s ample room. One would have thought it was a downward climb. Was sending Isaac out not a bad omen signalling tides were turning in the opposite of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham Isaac? Or how does one reconcile God&#8217;s &#8220;I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands&#8221; with the king&#8217;s &#8220;Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us&#8221;? The reality, however, remains that God was in a process and the expectation that His righteousness will not be cut short. As we would see, the intended destination was the Rehoboth area of Gerar, which was around the bushy places Abraham had marked with wells. But, God must have, in mercy, estimated the faith of Isaac and might have found it unable to take such giant strides.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The maps we read are scaled, wavy lines of massive landscapes. Yet, they help us navigate our ways successfully. The man who has heard instructions on what to do has only had a mind map of God&#8217;s intention for Him. The bigger picture would be more demanding. That is, the reality may demand many rerouting. But, of course, these maps or instructions from God will act as guideposts. Thus, when Bro Isaac Abraham was chased to Gerar&#8217;s Valley, the inner man&#8217;s eyes must have opened to the unexplored expanse of land in that region. Thus, he became freer to navigate. Our rerouting might be insight-, prayer- or persecution-driven. In Isaac&#8217;s case, it was resistance-based. Have you discovered your own?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Since he had the freedom to explore now, his instinct first went intelligently to the wells his father dug to re-dig them. Oh, how this established that Isaac knew well the covenant of God with his father and the landmarks he made memorials for this sake! It gave God reassurance too that Isaac was committed to this generational covenant. Still, God permitted resistance, and Isaac greeted it with humility. However, God needed Isaac to dig his own wells. He needed him to make his own landmarks and increase the memorials that mark the lands that would be handed to his generations to come. God required him to add Esek and Sitnah to the places upon which the sole of Isaac&#8217;s feet shall tread.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Have you the promise of God for your life and the confusion with which you battle to stamp your feet on the course set before you seem as dark as the dungeon Joseph found himself on His way to glory? Are there too many resistances on your route to Rehoboth? Has this confused you, and you are about to throw in the towel? I charge you to learn from this Patriarch that rerouting is one of the relaxation points on your road to Rehoboth. Have you been marched shamefully out of Gerar city with your activities in its Valley not spared by the opposition? Have you attempted to connect to those you think should disciple you in the faith, and satan-curated circumstances made them unreachable? God may have designed it that you should dig your own well. That is, seek Him as your present help in time of trouble and the most enjoyable company along the needy aisles of loneliness.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">May God grant us the grace to be flexible enough to discern through circumstances that He speaks through every avenue.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

Shalom.

Every Blessing in Christ.
