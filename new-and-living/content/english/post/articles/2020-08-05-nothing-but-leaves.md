### Gleaning from the Fig Tree

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Text: Mark 11:12-14 & 20.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  The previous day Jesus rode into Jerusalem as prophesied in the Old Testament in Zech. 9:9.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!<br />See, your king comes to you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteous and victorious,<br />lowly and riding on a donkey,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a colt, the foal of a donkey. (NIV)
</p>

He rode as a humble King triumphantly into Jerusalem. And when the evening was come, He continued His pilgrimage with His disciples &#8211; as if nothing grand happened during the day. The spiritual lesson here is that we must pack out of sight and mind the ashes of past glory and achievement &#8211; they belong to the past. Along with His disciples, He spent the night at Bethany. But the following morning when they departed from Bethany, the Master suddenly became hungry. Perhaps the streams of events of the previous day must have drained Him so much that He missed His dinner? Although this event happened so quickly as recorded in this account of the Gospel of Mark, our focus will be on the event in the next three verses from 12 to 14, following His great triumphant entry into Jerusalem.

As I discovered in this narrative story, Mark recorded that “**_when they left Bethany in the morning the following day, Jesus got hungry”_**. And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He moved closer if He could find any figs but He found **NOTHING BUT LEAVES**.

Beloved, the issue for consideration in this article is not only that the fig tree has nothing but leaves, but the deceptive and misleading appearance. Hence, Jesus cursed the fig tree, saying that, **_“May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”_** This, to me, is a weighty and critical matter for our consideration.

This brief event is very central to our Christian faith. And there are several profound instructions and lessons for our spiritual maturity in this article. As Christians, we cannot afford to be careless and presumptuous with our inward lives. Our words must be congruent with our lives. There must not be a reason why the unbelievers will have occasion to doubt our conviction or character. It is as much a worry why the leaves of the fig trees were bright green, but there were no fruits at all. And sadly enough, this is actually even twice as much the lives of many church goers today. They are vibrant and flashy outside, but inside is ‘an open sepulchre’ white washed from the outside. They are warm with frenzy feeling outside, but very cold inside. They smile at you outside but are ravenous wolves inside.

It is my prayer that the Holy Spirit will illuminate your eyes to deep spiritual truths that we shall examine in this brief event, as recorded in the Mark account of the Gospel.

As I look at its implication to our lives, let me reiterate that my focus is not on faith or that the tree actually dried up. My first concern is the deceptive and misleading appearance of the fig tree. But before I discuss this, permit me to quickly draw your attention to the journey from Jerusalem unto Bethany.

Friends, let it be known unto you that like Jesus and His twelve disciples, we are equally on a journey. Life is a pilgrimage filled with attendant needs, challenges, threats and opportunities. And you must be diligent to maximise each day as if it is the last.

As I read the New King James Version of Mark’s account of this event, it was striking to note that verse 12 began with ‘**Now…’** And this is very important matter to me. The adverb ‘Now’ has diverse meanings; **_at present_**_, **toda**y, **at this time**, **at this moment**_etc. By these synonyms of ‘now’ it means that even though the event is past, about 2-3 thousand years ago, the instructions and lessons in this passage are still present and fresh to you on this pilgrimage today. It is therefore instructive for you to take heed to the events happening in your lives right now. Are you living daily with eternity in view or carelessly? Are you diligent or negligent in your conduct and character as a follower of Christ? If Christ wants to eat fruit from your life right now, will He find fruit or nothing but leaves? Think on these questions and seek the Lord in prayer. I believe your sincere response is very crucial for your Christian journey. The Word of God is never old fashioned. It is forever fresh today, tomorrow and for ever. So, as for you reading this article, this instruction is for ‘now’ not later.

Secondly, as I looked further into the verse 12, I discovered that, the Bible said, **_‘…He was hungry_**.’ Even the Messiah was hungry. He was physically hungry for food. How can the One through whom all things were made be hungry? This is no doubt the humanity aspect of Christ. And without a shadow of doubt, there is a deep spiritual lesson to glean from the phrase- **_‘…He was hungry_**_._ But before I attempt to examine this profound phrase, let me briefly examine the nature of the fig tree.

As I discovered from this narrative, the fig tree grows fruit **_<u>before </u>_**the leaves open. But this particular fig tree having full leaves gave a false promise of a well mature fruit within it. This fig tree gave a deceptive, misleading representation in appearance. This to me is the central subject of this article. And it is a weighty matter to me as a Christian. And what about you reading this article?

So, when Jesus being hungry saw the bright green leaves, He thought that by nature the fruits would have matured. But as He drew closer, Jesus found **‘NOTHING BUT LEAVES’**. Jesus saw a bunch of misleading and deceptive leaves with no fruits inside. He saw nothing to satisfy His hunger; nothing to energise Him; nothing to nourish and strengthen His weak body; nothing to positively impact the Kingdom; nothing to nourish and nurture the soul of men for eternity. He saw no one to commit Himself to. Then, He did something strange &#8211; something the present generation will regard as being not religiously correct and too harsh – something they will regard as being blasphemous and overzealous. What today’s young person will say, ‘that’s deep man! He cursed the fig tree forever! He placed an everlasting curse on the fig tree! This is weighty matter to me.

Friends, let me have you know that, the spiritual truth in this article is beyond an ordinary cursed fig tree! Let me also have you know that Jesus is actually hungry for genuine souls to do exploit for the Kingdom. What the Holy Spirit is revealing to me is deep. The application is actually in relation to a productive and transforming Christian life. You have to brace up yourself to see beyond the fig trees. This is the Holy Spirit using His words to explain spiritual truth to you. And here are the spiritual truths to glean from this event in this Bible passage.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    This fig tree like many Christians today gave a false and deceptive appearance. It gave a pretentious misrepresentation of its true nature. The Bible says, “<em>You shall know them by their fruits…</em>” Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? I say ‘No.’ Therefore, it is fitting to note that many professing Christians live false and double standard lives. They have a gentle, pious appearance with religious language when in the public, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. They give a false impression of their true nature. They exaggerate their own self-worth. And so, when Jesus cursed the fig tree, He was simply instructing His disciples (and that includes you), that such will be the judgment of any professing Christian who is living a false and pretentious life. O, child of God, what is your story? What is your condition? Are you like this fig tree? Does your life and appearance give a false impression? Take heed, for there is a Day of Judgment – a day of reckoning. The trumpet may sound today. Amend your ways quickly before the Day comes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Again, Jesus was teaching us that you will know a false preacher or a false prophet by what proceed out of his mouth (i.e. Leaves-empty words, high sounding nonsense). The leaves represent outward attractions, show or ostentations. It represents shallow, weak Christian life. While the fruits refer to strong godly character and conduct. Fruit also refers to a man’s inner life &#8211; his thoughts, intents and nature. Jesus words here are powerful warning to the Church today and to you as well. So, as no man can see the content and the intent of the heart but only God, Jesus is teaching us here the signs to identify true Christians; ‘<strong><em>’You will know them by their fruits and not by their leaves’’</em></strong>. And this of course raises a further question &#8211; <strong>what are leaves and what are fruits?</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Let us see the answer to this in Luke 6:43-45 (NIV);

**_No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit._**** _<u>Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.</u> People do not pick figs from thorn bushes, or grapes from briers<u>.</u> <u>A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart</u>, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. <u>For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of</u>._**

#### 1.1&nbsp; What then are leaves in this context?

<ol type="i">
  <li>
    Leaves are not fit for eating.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leaves are external like gifts, talents etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leaves are attractions or entertainments; such that hucksters or peddlers of the Gospel (for example false teachers/false prophets and crafty men) with sweet-tongues employ to delude men.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leaves are modern technology that cannot heal a sick soul. They have good ambience, but are destructive heresies. They are very dangerous to the soul.
  </li>
  <li>
    They are church activities without unction. They are church promos instead of prayers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leaves are perishables meant for goats and cows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leaves also mean speaking many words with no power to convert souls.
  </li>
</ol>

#### 1.2&nbsp; What then are Fruits in this context?

<ol type="i">
  <li>
    Fruits are internal. They are of a pure heart and good conscience.
  </li>
  <li>
    A fruit nourishes and nurtures the body.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits have seed with fruit bearing capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits can be likened to godliness, righteousness, meekness, joy, love, patience etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits are edibles meant for human beings. They impact lives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits show that our words must be congruent with our lifestyles and the true teachings of Christ and the Scripture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits mean speaking much, but in few words, to convert the souls of men.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits are passion instead of fashion. Life changing and destiny transforming.
  </li>
  <li>
    The next lesson to glean from this short passage is that even though the Master is hungry for souls, He will not settle for less. He will not settle for leaves. He will not settle for lives that have not been properly cooked and baked. He will not use vessels who have not been correctly discipled. Yes, the Master desire to eat from our lives and drink from the cup in our hands, nevertheless, He will not compromise a life that has not been to the quarry, He will not use an undone, unfit and untrained vessel. The Lord desire that men are properly discipled, trimmed and tried for Kingdom purpose before being used. Herein lies the cruciality and criticality of ‘Discipleship’ as the centrality of raising faithful agents of transformation for this end time revival.
  </li>
</ol>

There is a passage in 1Kings 6:7 (NIV), to explain this;

“**_In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built”._**

Beloved, let me have you know that when Jesus cursed the fig tree, He was not being arbitrary but deliberate. He was teaching His disciples what awaits any professing Christians who fails to do the Will of the Father. So, even in the construction of the temple, only blocks dressed (trimmed and prefinished) at the quarry were used. This to me is very instructive, in that, if in the building of stones for the temple, the workmen thought it appropriate to use pre-finish stones at the quarry before bringing them into the temple as a principle, then it is highly crucial for a professing Christian to enrol at the quarry-site for personal discipling process. It is at the quarry all unfit and unwanted materials are evacuated. It is at the quarry that God empties every dead weight and sin that easily beset or trips us up. Things such as cultural wisdom, superstitions, poor doctrine, ‘our’ church tradition, pride etc. A true professing Christian cannot escape the quarry of spiritual discipline and training. It is at this God’s quarry site (personal discipleship training school) that the inner life of a professing Christian is purged, emptied and renewed in the knowledge of Christ. It is at the quarry that correct men and women are made for the temple (God).

Therefore, it is proper to mention that, this great omission is the bane of the Church today. Do you wonder why there is so much noise, grumbling, complaints, tradition, rebellion, distractions, high-sounding nonsense and activities inside the Church of God in our generation? The sisters are crying for the true Gospel; the young persons have become spiritual orphans; the brothers have lost direction and purpose. WHY? Because strange instruments, ungodly principles, worldly packaged marketing tools are dangerously being applied to deal with the famished souls in the temple (Church).

But O, Child of God, let me have you know that the WORD of GOD is the only comprehensive instrument to transform souls of men. No matter how lofty and high sounding; no matter how presentable the ambience of the church; no matter how attractive the church activities may be &#8211; they are colossal wastes without the consistent, cumulative and concerted teaching of the True Gospel. To attempt to duck and dive this Kingdom Gospel, you will be producing **_nothing but leaves_** and you will become as sounding brass or a mere tinkling cymbal! The only answer to the Church problem is the Message of the Cross-**The Mystery of the Gospel**. This is what Jesus was teaching us in this story of the ‘Fig Tree.’ God has His 7,000 who have not bowed down to Baal and his leaves; but souls who have fruits and are fruitful. Genuine souls who truly appreciate Christ hunger for fruits in their lives. Are you one? Are you available and willing?

This is very serious matter; hence you must desire the enduring power of God’s Word, and the inward renewing of your inner man which is able to deliver you to the uttermost.

  * The next gleaning in this encounter with the fig tree teaches us that the leaves represent membership. But the figs (fruits) that Jesus was actually looking for was fruits-representing **_Followership_**. Friends, as good as membership is to a church in terms of statistics, organisation etc., you must not settle only for this. You must consciously take deliberate effort to seek personal communion with the Lord. Seek out for a personal functional intimate relationship with God. Christ actually desires followership and not membership! Luke 9:23 says, “**_Then he said to them all:_** **_“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves (himself) and take up their (his) cross daily and <u>follow me</u>” (NIV)._**

From this short but instructive verse quoted above, it is absolutely clear that what Jesus desire is actually ‘**_Followership’_**. The act of following Christ must be a deliberate, conscious, persistent and personal free will. Please note that I am not against membership of a local Church. For clarity, I am a member of a local church as well. But in seeking membership, wisdom is principal to seek ‘**followership’** of Christ Jesus. Jesus Himself said, ‘**_… And follow me’_**_._ Friend, are you seeking membership or followership? When you seek to follow Christ, you will see His foot prints and in them plant your feet and follow Him duly. When you seek to follow Christ, you will truly appreciate why He is hungry for your spiritual growth and development. You will also hate sin and sinful habits. You will become fruitful even from a distance.&nbsp;

**_It is my prayer that the Lord will make you a ‘follower’ who follow Christ and not men. And may God make you a ‘followable’ vessel that men follow in order to follow Christ in Jesus name. Amen._**

In summary, let us look at just three scriptures to help us in our conclusion; Isa. 37:31; John 15:1-5; (ASV) Rom. 12:1-2. (GW).

_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above**. **(Isa. 37:31)**_

**_I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that they may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. &nbsp;I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing (John 15:1-5)_**

**_Brothers and sisters, in view of all we have just shared about God&#8217;s compassion, I encourage you to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, dedicated to God and pleasing to him. This kind of worship is appropriate for you. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants&#8211;what is good, pleasing, and perfect. (Rom. 12:1-2)_**

Beloved, for want of space in this article, I will only state the essentials for our conclusion. These essential points are based on the texts shown above. Please note that anyone who desires to know God must patiently devote time to God. In our quest to know Him, we must not count any time wasted &#8211; which is spent in the cultivation of intimate fellowship with God. We must give ourselves to meditation and reflection with persistent prayer and supplication hours on end. And as touching the cursed fig tree, Jesus is saying that there are no short cut exists. God cannot bow to our jet pack lifestyle and a microwave age. He cannot bow to our hush and dash pattern. No man plants a seed in the morning and thinks it will grow and become a fruit the same day. No, but every seed must patiently take root downwards, and gradually bear fruit upward, in its due time and season and after its own kind. And the result of this patient will be fruitfulness and righteousness.

#### 1.3&nbsp; The Way Out

Here are the essential facts for our conclusion:

  * You must know and accept God and His Son-Jesus Christ. You must believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead.
  * Beloved, take it or leave it, you are simply a branch nothing more, nothing less.
  * As long as you accept that you are a branch, you must simply remain in The Vine. Not on The Vine or around The Vine or even near, but must remain **in** The Vine.
  * Friend, also note that The Vine is not just a mere tree, but a personality! For the sake of description, it is referred to as ‘The Vine.’ Actually, The Vine is **Jesus Christ**. The **followers** are the Branches.
  * The only person who is capable and acceptable to prune you is Jesus. The reason is that you may bear more fruit (even richer and finer fruit), and not leaves.
  * The word ‘**prune**’ in this verse indicates a life-long process of becoming like Jesus called Discipleship.
  * The only comprehensive instrument by which men can be changed from ‘**_leaves’_** into ‘**_fruits_**’ is the Word of God.
  * To ‘**_abide in me’_** (inside Jesus) means to remain; to dwell deeply; to stay closer; to continue as His disciple; to withstand or endure without struggling, fighting or grumbling; to await the second and glorious coming of the Lord; to accept the spiritual discipline from the correct human handler without complaint or question; and finally to pay the price or penalty of; or suffer for being a follower (Disciple) of Christ &#8211; The Vine.
  * You can only bear fruit when (and not if) you remain in Christ and Christ remain in you. The lesson from the fig tree is that for us to bear fruit and be fruitful (producing evidence of our faith in Christ), we must dwell inside Christ. However, note that death to self is the principle of life.
  * No branch can bear fruit by itself without remaining in The Vine. So, for you to be fruitful, it simply means that you MUST remain in Christ. And not in letters, not in books, not in tradition, church doctrine or politics.
  * Friend, to abide means death; and for Christ to abide in you, it means eternal life. As for the fig tree, it could not remain in Christ (it could not wait for the due season of fruitfulness before giving out fruits), but instead gave out leaves out of season; hence Jesus cursed (judged) it because it was deceptive and misleading. The lesson here is that it is only in Christ that you can live a godly, righteous and sober life.
  * The meaning of ‘**cursed**’ indicate; cut-off, cast away from vital union with Christ. This is why Jesus cursed the fig tree. It is very crucial to bear in mind that you cannot function independent of The Vine. No one has a root of its own. And no branch can grow or bear fruit on its own without abiding in The Vine.
  * The crux of the matter being addressed here is SELF. This is the seat of the problem of mankind. We live in an age of self-will, self-confidence, self-love. It is rather sad that majority of professing Christians are self-deluded. They have very strong will, such that they don’t see the need of a Saviour yet they profess that they are saved. But, the reality is that such people are already cut-off from the heart beat of personal intimate relationship with Christ. No wonder many so called disciples have become drained and dried of divine flow of Christ life. But this ought not to be so. For without Christ, none of us can do anything. Hence, this fig tree had only leaves but no fruits.

Friends, if you do not want to be cut-off like this fig tree, **remain in Christ**! If you do not want to be thrown out like a broken branch, which withers and dies; gathered and dumped into the fire for burning, then ABIDE IN THE VINE &#8211; CHRIST.

#### 1.4&nbsp; HOW TO ABIDE IN THE VINE &#8211; how to remain fruitful.

Beloved, to explain this I shall briefly consider Rom. 12:1-2. Here also, I will only list out the critical issues to guide the gleanings.

  * In view of our discussion so far, the first response is for you to appreciate the mercies of God by voluntarily dedicating (set apart) your whole bodies as a living, willing and holy sacrifice well pleasing unto God, which is your rational and proper act of worship.
  * Secondly, you must determine in your mind (make a personal decision) that you will no longer be conformed to this world’s superficial customs and values. You **<u>must</u>** decide to reject the world’s fashion, culture, tradition, music, language and entertainment. They are cosmetic and artificial.
  * Thirdly, deliberately yield yourself to be transformed and progressively changed as you grow spiritually by carefully renewing of the way you think. You do this by actively reading, meditating and observing to do (respond to) everything that the Word of God says. You must grow daily living by acceptable Christian values and godly attitudes. You must NOT allow the world system to drag you down to its despicable level of mediocrity and immaturity.
  * Fourthly, then by this practical obedience to Godly instructions and corrections you prove (establish) for yourself what the Will of God is; and that it is good, and acceptable, and perfect plan and purpose for you.
  * Finally, let Christ through His Spirit be the one at work in you, both to will and to do (respond) according to His own good pleasure. It is by this you can bear fruit and be fruitful.

#### 1.5&nbsp; PRAYERS:

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Jesus is hungry for fruit. Therefore, pray that the Holy Spirit should give you a plain and simple understanding of His hunger for fruits in your own life. You need a deep revelation of what this means personally to you in Jesus name.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Scripture says that, <strong><em>seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came to it perhaps He could find fruit thereon…But nothing except leaves. </em></strong>Friend, ask the Lord to allow your own life to be fruitful even at a distance. Pray that your character will be congruent with the Word of God. And that your life will not cast a shadow of doubt to the heart of your family, friends, children, neighbour and colleagues in Jesus name.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Like many, the process of plucking fruit from a tree is a difficult one. It is therefore not painless. Ask the Lord that your life will not be difficult for Christ to eat from. Pray that the Cross should uproot everything that is stubborn, rebellious and self-independent in your life, so that you can remain in an unbroken union with Christ Jesus.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pray that nothing in your life will kill fruits and fruitfulness in the Body of Christ and in the Kingdom of God in Jesus name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plead with God to give you grace to personally hate sin that kills fruit of revival in the Church of God in Jesus name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beloved, ask God to give you a clear sense of appreciation of His hunger for fruit and fruitfulness in your life, family and the Church in Jesus name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Friend, also pray that the Lord should make you effective and efficient vessel both for life and godliness in Jesus name. Pray that you will not fail God and the Kingdom of God. Let there be no barrenness and still birth in your life and family in Jesus name.
  </li>
  <li>
    And finally pray that the same Cross that saves, slays you (MR SELF) so that, men may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. Amen
  </li>
</ol>

GOD BLESS YOU.
