  Absalom is dead (Final Part )
</h1>

### Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV)

**<u>What to do.</u>**

As we bring this article to a conclusion, I could see Joab was telling David what to do just as the Holy Spirit is presently speaking through various holy men and women what your response ought to be: God is speaking through Chats, songs, visions, dreams, prophecies, messages,; ‘Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants…’ What is God saying to you? **ARISE. GO FORTH. SPEAK.**

**Arise** to the fact that Absalom (your Old Man) is dead and buried! It means to wake up to the reality of victorious Christian living. Get out of your life of defeat of sin and bondage of satan because you have dwelt too long on the alley of darkness and valley of the shadow of death. So, jump out into the marvellous light of the Kingdom of God in the light. (Col.1:12-13). Stop struggling with it, simply trust in Jesus by handing over your life to Him. The Holy Spirit is saying, &#8216;can&#8217;t you see gross darkness covering the earth and the people? Don’t keep the Master waiting for His glory shall rise upon thee as you respond in obedience. You were born to shine the life light so that, sin (many sinful Absalom) will not multiply in the land any longer. But, if your David fails to arise, shine, then the temple will remain empty, and darkness will prevail over it. Dare to be a David, dare to be a Daniel? Then, it is time to Arise, shine for your Absalom is dead and your King David (Christ) must return to the throne! Why do you still doubt the scriptures? He (your old man) died on the cross to live no more. Stop sitting down (living) as though he is still alive. Accept it. It is a settled matter. Arise to this truth and stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free. Amen!

** **** ****Go forth**

But before you can go forth, you must first come out of every confinement/room that Satan has subtly to keep you in. Come out of every sinful habit and carnal pleasure. Out of every sinful addiction and corruption. Out of ungodly marriage and relationships that the Old Man has left you bound. Out of failure and defeat, you have suffered for long in the hands of the taskmaster. Come out of that deception and blame. The man Absalom before he died, deceived the father, the brothers, Joab, two hundred men who followed him not knowing his evil intentions. In case you are in a bad company or organization whereby your conscience is pricking you daily, you need to heed this warning before it is too late for you. For all you care, you might be serving an Absalom-who is an enemy of God and the Kingdom of God. Just like the Old Man, Absalom was an enemy of joy, peace, and righteousness of the Holy Spirit. Absalom was an agent of confusion and shame. He was a terror to Israel waiting to destroy the purpose of God.

Therefore, God is calling on you to Go forth in victory and dominion. Go forth in His name and by His Word. You can only do so by deliberately looking at the Cross. And it takes faith to look at the Cross. But note that in your going forth, it must be by **_denying yourself and daily carrying your cross and following Jesus_**. (Lk.9:23) You will need to always place the Cross before you because the enemy you are dealing with is clever and wicked. So, you must steadfastly cling to the Cross i.e., you must go forth in the power of the Gospel of Christ. Putting on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. You must also Go forth with the testimony of Christ, which is the spirit of Prophecy. Remember that in going forth, you will also require as a matter of necessity the following: Belt of truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, having your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace, putting on the shield of faith, whereby you shall quench the fiery darts of the wicked one.

In addition, you need to be fortified with the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and finally, the power of prayer and supplication in the Spirit, watching with patience and perseverance as you Go forth.

** ****Speak** **this truth**.

It is what a man knows that he will speak. So, you must keep **_knowing this_**…**_that our Old Man has been crucified with Christ on the Cross…_** Don’t allow the enemy to shut your mouth. Speak it. Affirm it. Stand on it. Re-affirm it in the face of every lie and trick of the enemy. Don’t be silent. Speak it. Learn the truth, Love the Truth, Live the truth. The scripture says;

**<sup> ‘</sup>****_that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation._** (Rom.10:9-10)

If you don’t do this, the danger is that the latter end may be worse than the beginning. In this passage (vs7b), Joab was warning David about a serious matter. Equally, that was what Christ was also noting in Lk 11:24-26. On the one hand, the old man is dead and evacuated. However, a vacuum is now left that needs to be filled by the King of Kings. Failure to fill this vacuum risks him who has gone to return with far stronger adversaries more wicked than the earlier; the latter end is worse than the beginning.

As such, having heard of the death of the Absalom, there is a need to accept it as the death of the Old Man; Joab&#8217;s charge was, ‘_then arise, go forth and speak this truth’_.

By the way, what is this truth that you must speak? The truth we are talking about is not relative but the absolute truth. The truth that Jesus came in the flesh, Jesus died on the Cross, Jesus was buried and rose from the dead on the third day. The truth is reality. It is that Jesus is the resurrection and life. He has risen from the dead. He is no more in the grave. He is now seated upon the throne at the right hand of the Father almighty on High and that He is coming soon! This is the Good News that we must herald to the whole world that Jesus Christ is risen and He is on the throne. Proclaim it on the hill, in the valley, in the park, on the train, on land, on the sea, in the air, in the marketplace, workplaces, and everywhere. Instead of spending your precious time on the internet, the news, argument, discussion, politics, fashion, on sports and movies, let us all arise and proclaim everywhere the Truth and the second coming of the King of kings and the Lord of Lords.

Enough with blaming each other in the churches, enough with spreading innuendos and malicious statements about others in the Body of Christ. It is high time we ceased such corrupt practices and arise, go forth and speak of the Good News. The Good News of our salvation from sin, self, Satan, and the world system. Now our Absalom (Old Man) is dead. Let us all arise, go forth, and bring back the King Jesus again to reign and rule in our hearts forever, on the pulpit, on the pews.  Enough of procrastination, unbelief, negativity, jealousy, and fear. Let&#8217;s arise and talk about Jesus. Let&#8217;s make Him famous on every platform, nation, and continent. This is our collective responsibility. From the priests, to the prophets; from the evangelist to the teachers and pastors; from the deacons to the elders in the churches; from the apex leaders to the gatekeepers, let us all arise and go forth in this day of his power. There is a revival going on out there. Heaven is ready, but are you ready? Why are you still holding out? Yet you are my brothers and sisters in Christ, my brethren saved by grace through faith in the blood of the Lamb! The Prophet Isaiah 52:7 says; ‘**_How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!’_**

Finally, never forget the **ENTHRONING** of the King of Kings back into His rightful place in the centre of your heart. Ask the Holy Spirit to come into your life to reign and rule as the sovereign Lord. Let Christ take His place and give Him first place in your life, marriage, business, work, ministry, home, education, and devotion. Invite Him into everything you do and into all your decisions.

Confess your sins, repent and acknowledge Him as the king. Consult Him. Give Him the reins of your heart and let Him lead you. Let Him come and live His victorious life in you. Carry Him everywhere you go, saying that … ‘**Absalom is dead. Enthrone the King of Kings’.**

**It is our prayer that as you come into contact with this article, that you will encounter the risen Christ personally. May the Spirit of God illuminate your eyes in the inner man to behold with an increasing degree the profound imageries of Calvary and the Man of Calvary who gave His life as a ransom for you. So, that the way you leave hereafter will honour and please the Lord, and your life will produce every kind of good fruit. Then, you will grow as you learn to know God better and better in your personal walk with Him in Jesus name. Shalom!**

**Grace be multiplied unto you.**
