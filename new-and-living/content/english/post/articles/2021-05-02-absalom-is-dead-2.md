  Absalom is dead (Part 2)
</h1>

### Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7

**_<u>Who is this Old Man?</u>_**

At this stage, there is a quiet introduction of the Old Man. And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom. May the Lord illuminate your heart.

Human nature is generally referred to in some Bible versions as the Old Man or the Flesh. It is the art of being human in character, conduct, and conversation. We all inherited human nature by birth. Everyone born of woman, no matter your race, education, colour, gender, status, and position, is born with the natural traits of the human fallen nature. This human nature is the worthless manner of life that we received from our ancestors. It is an impossible road to heaven. This is the kind of life that Absalom exhibited in this narrative as we shall soon discover for our learning and correction. This kind of life cannot be changed by fasting, giving an offering, tithes, prayer, good works, singing, or church attendance. For the scripture says, **_‘that which is born of the flesh is flesh…’_** and they that are of the flesh **_cannot_** please God at all.

**_<u>What are the activities of the Old Man?</u>_**

Let us closely look at Galatians 5:19-21;

**_Now the works of the flesh are <u>manifest</u>, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal.5:19-21)._** KJV.

**_What human nature does is <u>quite plain</u>. <u>It shows itself</u> in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions; in the worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups; they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before: those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God_**. (GNT)

What the Old Man does is quite plain. The Old Man loves to show itself anywhere, anytime, and in anybody. It can show itself in the church, in fellowship, at home, in the workplace. You will shortly see a catalogue of these dead works being exhibited by Absalom. You must note also that the Flesh does not only show itself in abominable acts but also seemingly good things.

According to the scripture, I discovered that the old man has many aliases. He is also called the Natural man, the Carnal man, the Human Nature, Mr. Flesh. Mr. Iniquity, Selfish Man, Fallen Man, Corrupt/Sinful Nature. The Old Man is unruly, incorrigible, rebellious, and disobedient. He is envious by nature. He loves to cover up. He cannot stand the presence of God and the life light. He easily passes blame. He gives excuses. He is given to lies. He loves to be popular, worshipped, and celebrated. He seeks after external beauty and not inward beauty of meekness and quiet spirit. He is vengeful and wicked. Pride is innate to the Old Man. He is ungrateful, unpleasing, impatient, and inconsiderate. He is lawless and godless. He loves anything that is darkness. He is always envious, argumentative, defensive, and unapologetic. Hates to be corrected. Hates embarrassment and disgrace. He loves to cover up. Old Man always wants to have his own way and own rule. He makes you be ashamed when you meet your mates without being ready. He is unforgiving. He loves acceptance, acquisition, achievement. Always find fault in practically everything. This is the life we inherited from the fallen Adam and Eve after they were banished from the presence of the Lord.

**<u>GOD’S Judgment on the Old Man and the Instrument</u>**. (Job 14:14; 1John 3:8; Rev, 21:8; Rom.6:6; Gal.2:20)

The verdict of God on the Old Man is death. For he is corrupt all the way. He cannot be pampered, cajoled, or nursed. He is older than you and me. You can neither improve on him nor nourish him with the hope that it will change and please God. And don&#8217;t attempt to cherish the Old Man. The answer to the alluring potent power of sinful nature is no, no, a million times. Whenever you find a sinning man or woman, it simply shows that they are under the domination and control of the Old Man. This Old Man has been sinning from the beginning. Sin is not your friend. Sin is your enemy.

So, if you have been genuinely born into the holy family of God, you have the Heavenly DNA in you. Hence, you don’t make sin a lifestyle again. The reason is that the lawless intrinsic character of the devil is no more in you. There are two natures, sinful nature (from the Old Man) and godly nature (from God upon being born again of the Spirit). To live by the Spirit is to be controlled and governed by God&#8217;s Will in purpose, action, and thought. And to live by the flesh is to be controlled and ruled over by your own selfish will, impulse, emotions, and carnal cravings.

Therefore, the reason why Jesus was made manifest was to destroy the works that the devil has done in our lives through the Old Man. And God&#8217;s only divine provision for dealing with the Flesh is the Cross. Hence, the only way to terminate the unruly, rebellious, arrogant, and deceptive nature of Absalom is the Cross. For without this David, his men, and the people of Israel cannot have lasting peace, progress, and prosperity.

Subsequently, it is imperative that you MUST as a necessity keep “**_knowing this… that (your) the Old Man has been crucified with Christ on the Cross…”_**
