  <strong>&#8220;&#8230;Rehoboth&#8230;&#8221;</strong>
</h1>

### **Key Text**: **Genesis 26:1-22**

There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.

The correlation between Abraham&#8217;s and Isaac&#8217;s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.

  <strong>Restoration (Genesis 26:22) </strong>
</h2>

<span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;Hope deferred makes the heart sick,&#8221; said that realistic expression in Proverbs 13:12, &#8220;But desire fulfilled is a tree of life.&#8221; The Chapter opens with famine, followed by a forbiddance to progress to Egypt in pastures green. Due obedience met with rejection and stiff resistance, livestock-, irrigation-, and life-sustaining wells were stumped. Isaac was disgracefully ushered out of the Philistine Capital, Gerar, like a traitor. From living in kingly quarters in Gerar, He descended to living in the abandoned valley of Gerar. Not even the epileptic Philistines lived there. While proceeding to the suburb, Isaac&#8217;s servants were waylaid in two other towns. Here if the Philistines needed water, they so needed to travel. Yet, the mileage did not discourage them from this journey because of sheer envy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">All these put together if Isaac had no personal relationship with God and a vivid example of hIs father&#8217;s walk with God, should have made him falter. I would have been tempted to doubt and despair. Many like me would have doubted God&#8217;s voice, saying, &#8220;Did I really hear God say&#8230;? or it might just have been a mere dream! Maybe I fabricated it.&#8221; What an example of faith Isaac was demonstrating. He knew Abraham to have known God to be He who calls things that be not as though they were. He anchored His trust on that. And this defied the blast of persecution and pressure with strength divine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Have you passed through a challenging time? How long? Years, Decades? We would not know. For the first time, after a series of struggles and displacement, He got to a land of &#8220;No opposition.&#8221; I perceive the more wells Isaac dug and were filled, the farther away he moved from the Philistines even while in their territory. Perhaps he was progressing farther and farther to a place beyond their reasonable or coverable reach or places where they would have tagged wasteland. If true. The farther away from them Isaac journeyed, the closer he came to the land of abundance. Little wonder, on reaching Rehoboth, a land devoid of opposition, He progressed to Beersheba since He was out of reach of these cruel Philistines. Friend, who is your cruel Philistines? No matter who they are, count it all joy! James 1:2</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Rebehoth, to Isaac, was a tree of life. *</span>_<span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;Because he said, &#8216;For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be **</span>****<span data-contrast="auto">fruitful** </span>****<span data-contrast="auto">in the land.'&#8221;* </span>_<span data-contrast="auto">Although he had once *</span>_<span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;reaped in the same year a hundred folds,&#8221;*</span>_ <span data-contrast="auto">he knew there was more to God&#8217;s promise. And the realization of Rehoboth – the roomy space, devoid of quarrelling – was an assurance that God was at work. It was fruitfulness as a reward for destitution. It was blessings over scarcity. It was a life of peace of dispute. It is a place of freedom of expansion as the need arose. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Rehoboth was a place where those who envied him before and displaced him now beg to live at his mercy. It is a place where naturally his fame went abroad, even faster than when he was a next-door neighbour to Abimelech. It is a place where those who monitored him to his woe will be surprised at the wonder God attained through him. Those who anticipated evil will jaw-drop to see what God can do. It is a place where kings saw Isaac&#8217;s light shining in the darkness, with plenty in famine and safety in trouble. And they arise and come *</span>_<span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;to the brightness of&#8221;* </span>_<span data-contrast="auto">his *</span>_<span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;rising.&#8221;*</span>_<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The tides turned at Rehoboth, and every forward direction that Isaac went was blessed. The gentile king and his cabinet had to come to kiss this prince lest he mobilizes his aggrieved servant to take possession of the land of Philistine. They were in danger now! There is ample space for blessing, expansion and training for war now. The best political decision Abimelech could come to was to mobilize his famished army to beg for safety. May you experience such a fulfilling testimony too by God&#8217;s grace.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">I pray soon that all your years that has been eaten up by cankerworm shall be restored in Jesus name. Then the joy that ousts pain can be known and enjoyed, as did Isaac. Amen!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

Shalom.

Every Blessing in Christ.
