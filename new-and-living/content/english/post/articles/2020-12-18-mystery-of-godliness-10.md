  <strong><em>WHAT ARE THE PROVISIONS?</em></strong>
</h2>

Since anything that comes with the sinful nature cannot please God, it means that God had a plan to deal with sins and the sinful nature. God truly does not want to bestow unending fame upon Mr. flesh at all. So, He made adequate provision for us to experience total deliverance from it. By God&#8217;s mercy, there is an end to the activities of Mr. flesh and Old Man himself.

The flesh cannot be suppressed and pampered. Even the legalism cannot deal with Mr. Flesh. So, for God to be warning man of the consequence of hell, and He has no way of escape for the man, then it would be vague to point it to man. For if there is no way out of the danger of indulging in the activities of the sinful nature, then our Gospel is weak and vain. But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the redemption in the Blood of Jesus!

**1.1 FIRST PROVISION- THE BLOOD PROVISION**

Key Texts: (Lev. 17:1-8; 17:11; Heb. 9:10-12 NIV**).**

_The_ _Lord_ _said to Moses,<sup> </sup>“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘This is what the_ _Lord_ _has commanded&#8230;_ _This is so the Israelites will bring to the Lord the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the Lord, at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings. <sup> </sup>The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the Lord. <sup> </sup>They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.’_

_<sup> </sup>__“Say to them: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice_ _and does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the Lord must be cut off from the people of Israel._

_“‘I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood, and I will cut them off from the people._ _<sup> </sup>**<u>For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life</u>**._

From Lev. 17 above, only the High Priest can atone for peace offering before the LORD. When a man sins against his body or another person, he had done so against the LORD, who is the Head of the body. So, for a sinner man to have fellowship with God, he must acknowledge his sins, confess, repent from his sins and turn away. Therefore, the blood is primarily for GOD. Hence, GOD provided the blood of JESUS as a means for our daily deliverance from sins. Jesus shed His blood once and for all for mankind. JESUS is now both our HIGH PRIEST and SACRIFICIAL LAMB cf. Heb. 9:11-12; 10: 5-14; 19-22 (NLT).

**<u>Please note</u>** the Scripture in Heb. 10:22 which says that, _the Blood of JESUS cleanses our hearts from an evil conscience_. This is because our heart [which cannot be cleansed but requires an exchange] is desperately wicked and deceitful (Jer.17:9 KJV).

Consequently, the solution, is a new heart (Ezek. 36:26 NKJV). For example, do you wash and iron the garment you are going to throw away into the bin? No, you wouldn&#8217;t because there is no need to. What this infers is that an un-regenerated heart does not need renovation, retouching or repainting, but a replacement. A complete change of heart and new nature is what you need. This means that you ask God to change your heart and renew the right spirit within you.

**_<u>DISCUSSION POINT</u>_**

* From the key texts above, discuss the Old Testament priesthood activities of animal sacrifice for atonement and its implication to you and many in the Church of God today.
* From the above, do you think that GOD was being arbitrary when He demanded for blood sacrifice from sinners as atonement for their sins?
* How many times or for how long do you think a sinner will have to bring to the priest animal (blood) sacrifice as atonement for his sins?
* What do you think would have been the implication of this if GOD did not send JESUS to pour out His soul once and for all to cleanse us from our sins?

**1.2 Further Gleaning**:

**a. John 1:29** “_The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the **<u>sin</u>** of the world!_

b. See also **1 John 1:9** “_If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our **<u>sins</u>** and purify us from all unrighteousness_.

* Compare and contrast the two passages above.
* To whom was John the Baptist referring to? And was it a misprint of the use of &#8216;**sin**’ (singular) and not ‘**sins**’ (plural)?
* If you agree with whom John the Baptist was referring to in v29, do you now believe that God has made available provision for your deliverance from sins before the foundation of the earth? (Rev.13:8; 5:9)
* Why do you think many believers today are still following the old traditional rites of animal sacrifices as a means of atonement? Can this please GOD?

It is important for you to know that, as powerful as the blood of JESUS is to remove all sins, it can **<u>NOT</u>** deal with Mr. Flesh. Not that it is weak, but that it was not provided to deal with **sin, but its products**. For God has made alternative provision for dealing with the sinful nature. This we shall study in the next lesson.

As I have also discovered, the power of sin is not actually in sin, but in its power to separate a man from the Lord. Sin has the power to remove divine immunity from the child of God who makes sin a practice. If God was to mark our iniquity, no man can stand before Him. For all our righteousness is like a filthy rag. Even the anger of a man cannot work the righteousness of God (James 1:20).

Therefore, the Blood provision is not only for sinners and weak people. It equally for the strong man or woman for as long as he/she confesses and repents from sin. Man must humble himself before the Lord so that he may obtain mercy and forgiveness of sins.

Friend, no matter the number of sacrifices, and the cost, it cannot cleanse away your sins. Not even fasting, charitable deeds, weeping, gifts can undo or cleanse you from sins, but the **BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST**. This is the First provision for our deliverance from sins.

Sins must be confessed and genuinely repented from; if not, you will not make progress in life. **_(Prov. 28:13)_**. No formula, theory or strategy can wash away your sins or appease the stubborn and unruly nature of the Old Man. It is the omission of this truth that has made many to become _deliverance candidates_. And this is the bane of average church-goer today.

People are searching for a quick fix to their problems. There is no quick fix in the Bible to the matter of washing away of your sins. The only answer is the Blood of JESUS!  It is priceless, spotless and faultless **(1Pet.1:18-19)**. It is pure and powerful. It speaks better things than the blood of Abel. It saves, protects, speaks, heals, preserves, gives us access to GOD and purifies our conscience from sins. **(Heb. 10:22)**. Please reflect on the lyrics of this hymn below:

  1. Let us now look at why the blood of Jesus is effective to wash away our sins.

**<u>1.3 The Efficacies of the Blood of Jesus</u>**

* The blood is offered primarily to appease GOD &#8211; Lev. 17:1-6, Heb. 9:11-12 (KJV); to remove the effects of sin that we obtain forgiveness.
* The blood is so effective in cleansing us from our sins &#8211; 1John 1:7, 9 (KJV);

* It also gives us access to GOD; it purifies our consciences &#8211; Heb. 10:22 (KJV);
* The blood of Jesus restores us to God upon true repentance from our sins. (Heb.10:9)
* We have fellowship with GOD by the Blood of JESUS &#8211; 1John 1:7 (NKJV); (We now experience a progressive and continuous cleansing.
* It speaks better things than the blood of Abel &#8211; Heb. 12:24 (NKJV);
* It acts as an inter-phase between us and GOD so that we can have communion with Him. (Exo. 29:44)
* By the blood of the Lamb, we overcame the devil &#8211; Rev 12:11 (KJV);
* The Blood of Jesus confirms that our sins are forgiven. Eph. 1:7 (GNB)
* It took away from us the guilt of sins (Rom. 8:1-4).
* The blood of Jesus now sustains and suspends the judgment of God until our sanctification is complete. Even our holiness (sanctification) does not downplay the efficacy of the blood of Jesus.
* Through the blood of Jesus, we now have a new and living way to God. (Heb. 10:20).
* According to Col. 2:14, the blood of Jesus blotted out and still blots out all the unfavourable records of our wrongdoings, and renders the devil charges filed against us null and void.
* The Blood of Jesus is also for our deliverance, healing and protection.
* Discuss further the efficacy of the blood as provision for our deliverance from sins using these texts &#8211; ( **26:27-28; Acts 20:28; Col. 1:20; Ephes. 1:7; Heb. 9:14; 9:22; 10:19; 13:12; 1Jhn. 1:7; Lk. 22:20; Rev. 1:5; 12:11**).
