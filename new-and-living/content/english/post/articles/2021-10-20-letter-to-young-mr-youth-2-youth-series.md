## 1.1Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Valley of Dry Bones ðŸ¦´ðŸ¦´

We have never heard of the mountain of dry bones but we have read of the valley of dry bones. Whose dead bones, were they?

Men who once pursued their visions with vigour, self-determination. Men who conceived their dreams with crystal clear vision and articulated them.

Men whose initial efforts showed great prospect and curiously aroused the interests of many.

But, how come they fainted with strength drained to the bones? Perhaps, they got weak and fell, and there was no one to lift them.

Brother, youthful Young man, you had better be careful!

Who is the glory and the lifter of your head when the chips are down? When the valleys are full of ditches, wherein men struggle to stamp their feet. Who will be your anchor to keep your famished soul, where all men starve? Men battle so well in the valley. Who will give you the strength to blaze through the troop of your competing hosts and leap over their ramps? And climb the holy mountain?

Ah! In the valley water is scarce! But there are many dry bones. Who will refresh your soul?

Shalom!
