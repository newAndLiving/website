    <strong><em>1.1: THE THREE ASPECTS OF MAN </em></strong>
  </h4>
  
  <h4>
    <em>Mankind is of three components: A man has a <strong>spirit</strong>, with a <strong>soul</strong> inside the <strong>body</strong>. (1Thess. 5:23).</em>
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    <strong><u>THE SPIRIT</u></strong><em> (Consist of our Intuition, fellowship and conscience) <strong>&#8211; The Generating/Manufacturing Centre.</strong></em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><u>THE SOUL</u></strong><em> (Comprises of our Intellect, Will and Emotion &#8211; </em><strong><em>T</em></strong><strong><em>he Warehouse.</em></strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><u>THE BODY</u></strong><em> (feelings show itself through the Vent. i.e. hands, eyes, mouth</em> &#8211; <strong>The Retail Outlets</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    <u>1.2: Three Major Vents of dead works</u>
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    <strong>In Our Thoughts</strong>: [Matt. 12:24-25,31; Isa. 55:6-7; Matt. 5:27-28; Matt. 15:19].
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>In Our words</strong>: [Prov. 10:19 MSG, AMP, ERV; Matt. 12:36-37 MSG, ERV; Eph. 4:29 NKJV, ERV].
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>In Our Deeds/Actions</strong>: [Gal. 5:19-21; Col. 3:5-9; Matt. 5:23-24; 6:14-15]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>              THOUGHTS              DECISION                             DEEDS/ACTION</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>                    MIND                        WILL                           EMOTIONS/FEELINGS</strong>
  </p>

    On the outside, it seems that nothing happened because the container (body covering) remains the same, and this is the reason why men continue to multiply iniquity. But on the inside, another man has taken over called Mr. Flesh. At this stage, the fallen man goes about with activities of the flesh. The reason is that the soul (the distribution centre) has become decayed and contaminated with dead works. Some of the dead works listed in Gal. 5:19-21 are activities of the degenerated spirit of the fallen man. Even though the standard of God was righteousness, yet the fallen man could not do what was right because it cannot. The flesh cannot serve God and at the same time, it cannot inherit the Kingdom of God (Rom 8:5-8).
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    1.3 The Works, and Manifestations of Human nature.
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    What the human nature or the flesh does is quite plain or obvious. It loves to show itself in diverse ways and diverse places. Be it in the workplace, in the church, in the fellowship, in the prayer room, in the political parties, in the market place or school. There is a person behind the manifestation of the dead works, who is called the Old Man. He has many aliases; Carnal Man, Sinful man, Human Nature, Natural Man etc.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, whenever you notice the manifestation of the human nature in you, do not explain it away or rationalise it. Do not even begin to speak in tongues or give excuses. Do not pretend that it is not there, because it cannot be hidden, for it shows itself. Your first and foremost labour is to expose it. This is because anything that comes with Mr. flesh cannot please God. The effects of the activities of Mr. flesh can be devastating. It contaminates the whole body if you keep silent about it. Remember, it shows itself….!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example, if you used to be short-tempered or proud under the former owner-occupier, but now you find that in a church meeting or family meeting the anger resurfaces, you do not need to wait any longer to see that it is still there. Your immediate response is to go back to God in prayer for deliverance from it. This sinful nature can show itself in idolatry, in pride, during song ministration and even in sermon ministration. It is capable of doing not only bad things but good things as well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All the management courses on self-esteem, self-aggrandisement, self-control, self-development, self-will are all manifestations of human nature. When you discover that you are too proud to simply say &#8216;I am sorry&#8217; whether you are wrong or not, you are seeing Mr. Self showing itself. All matters of cover-up, deception, manipulation, intimidation and control are simply witchcraft, which is a manifestation of human nature. Do you remember when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden of Eden? They justified and defended themselves. They apportioned blames. Adam apportioned blame on Eve. Eve in turn apportioned blame of Satan. All these are activities of human nature.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self loves to impress men, even in spiritual matters. It can organise prayer and fasting with long vigil. It is the one behind tradition, culture, religion, superstitions, native wisdom, honour killing, media, entertainment, sports etc.. Self loves to puff up in the public. The same self is behind the aspect of insecurity, over supervision, rules and regulations. Where you see too many rules and regulations, the self is in charge. Self always insists on &#8216;<em>my own way or nothing</em>.&#8217;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Self is the one behind polygamy (marrying more than one wife). Self is behind adultery and fornication in the church. It is a full-blown sin virus that is ravaging and damaging the church today. Self is also behind seductive dressing by women which captivate and capture men on the pulpit. This human nature is not your friend but your enemy. You must lay it bare at the Cross.

  <h4>
    1.4 What is God’s verdict on the human nature?
  </h4>
  
  <h4>
    [John 3:3, 5-6, Deut. 21:18-21, 1Pet.1:18, Rom. 8:6-8]
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Questions</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    a. The verdict of God to human nature is not a replacement. It is not a renovation, not rebranding, not restructuring or re-strategizing. It is simple and plain. What is it then? See Job 14:14, 1Jh. 3:8, Rev. 21:8.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    b. Is it possible for that which is born of the flesh to be managed and supervised along with the kingdom of God?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    c. Study Deut. 21:18-21 and Rom. 8:6-8 again. Discuss what you discovered about your human nature.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    d. Can the flesh inherit the kingdom of God? If No, why not?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    e. Why must you not pamper, cajole, hide and cherish the human nature?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    f. Can you maintain your Mr. Flesh and still please God?
