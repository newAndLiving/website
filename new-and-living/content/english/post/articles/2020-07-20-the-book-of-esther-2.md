### God, Guiding and Controlling his Purpose Behind the Scene

#### Gleanings from the book of Esther Chapter 2

#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical Lessons from the book of Esther

Esther chapter 1: 1— 9

1 Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces,

2 in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa, the capital,

3 in the third year of his reign he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,

4 while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendour and pomp of his greatness for many days, 180 days.

5 And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa, the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of the garden of the king&#8217;s palace.

6 There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.

7 Drinks were served in golden vessels, vessels of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king.

8 And the drinking was according to this edict: &#8220;There is no compulsion.&#8221; For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired.

9 Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus.

(NKJV)

Beloved, as I look carefully at this beginning of the book of Esther, it is profound that it began with the phrase, &#8220;Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces; That in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa, the capital…&#8221;

As I began to carefully study the narrative story of Esther, there are so many issues that the Holy Spirit will be confronting us as individuals, which are needful for our daily practical Christian life. They are lessons to both learn and apply for life and godliness. And God will be revealing the secret of His kingdom to us through the knowledge of Him by the Holy Spirit. So, let us begin our study.

It is very interesting to note that the opening verse of this book of Esther began with &#8216;Now…&#8217; But it is however referring to past days of King Ahasuerus which is seemingly strange. However, as I pressed further with the Holy Spirit to shed more light on this, it became clear to me that even though the story is past; even though the Scripture has been written thousands of years past; it is still present (real-time) and applicable for me today. The truth is that history will always repeat itself, but many have not learned from it. So, the LORD is bringing it again. This to me is instructive for my learning and daily application.

And on this premise, it is very crucial to briefly consider the days of this pagan king, while he was on the throne in his royal kingdom. Because, if truly I am a new creature and old things have passed away, then all things must become new; including the life within me. So, what I have learned is that my life is only a container or throne upon which the King of Kings must dwell in and reign. Even so, even as King Ahasuerus&#8217; reign was limited by time life, equally we are limited as well by death. But Christ, the King of Kings, is no more limited by death and time, for He is risen and forever liveth. Hence, Christ desires to indwell your life as the King of Kings.

Therefore, necessity behooves that today (during our lifetime), we can and must only live for Jesus. But the big question before us is still the matter of, &#8220;What are you presently doing in your times like this (before the return of the coming King?&#8221; King Ahasuerus is no more, but we are still living. But what are you living for and unto in times like this?

Now, for understanding purpose, let us say that King Ahasuerus reigned for 30years, and there are 365days in a year, it means that he ruled for 10,950 days on the throne at Susa, the capital. Besides, each day of a man, and that of a king for that matter is filled with troubles, battles, ceremonies, etc. Meaning, we cannot afford to gloss over how the king spent his days during his tenure. Also, we shall give an account of how we lived each day in this body one day? The Scripture says in 2Cor.5:10 that, &#8220;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in this body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.&#8221;

Beloved, as I read this verse, I cringe with fear. I do not know about you, but as I meditated on the phrase &#8220;…that everyone may receive the things done in this body…&#8221; my understanding of this phrase is that there is an invisible digital audio-visual recorder that keeps account of everything done in this body. Be it action, words, thoughts, and motives ever carried out in this body since I was born. Although the Bible says that my sins and iniquities He will remember no more, but what about what I have done since I became a new-creation man in presumption? What about the records of broken ordinances and promises? What have I done in this body since I became a minister of the Good News? How have I spent yesterday and today? Have I spent it on deceitfulness, worry, anxiety, or unforgiveness? If the trumpet sound now, where would my soul go to? Have I spent my days in this body serving the King of kings or serving the Old Man (Mr. Flesh)?

Do you know that how a man spends his days in this body, will determine where he will end up when he departs from this body? So, please May I then remind you again, that our days are numbered, and we cannot afford to live unto ourselves and for ourselves, but for Him and unto Him, who loved us and gave His life for us as a ransom. It is, therefore, expedient that we live with eternity in view. We must not engage our ransomed soul with jokes, jests, and incomplete gospel. Rather, we must feed our souls with The True Gospel. For the Word of God is the comprehensive divine instrument given by God unto man to be changed inside-out.

Consequently, as time went on, this pagan king spent his days feasting and drinking strong drinks with the nobles, princes, and the people. He even became high in spirit, under the influence of alcohol. Also, he spent his days pleasing Mr. Self &#8211; the Old man. Do you know that it&#8217;s frightening to note that king Ahasuerus spent 187 days (six months and seven days) in feasting and drinking? And without doubt, the days were filled and flooded with revelling, partying, debauchery, drunkenness, seduction, and murders. So, as I carefully look into how this pagan-king spent his days, permit me to ask, &#8216;Child of God&#8217; (who has been saved not by natural succession or descent, but by grace), how will you spend the rest of your days here on earth? What if the trumpet sounds right in your sleep, before the breaking of the day? Will the LORD find you faithful in this body?

I believe that King Ahasuerus became king by vain conversation, received by established tradition and native wisdom from his ancestors. But as for you, you have been redeemed by the precious and priceless blood of the Lamb of God, without blemish and spot. It is, therefore, expedient that you spend your days in holy fear and trembling in this body before the LORD. As a child of God, you must spend your days redeeming the time; for the days are evil. You must infuse your life into the Mystery of godliness. Let the Mystery of the Gospel be your food and nourishment. You must begin your days with the LORD in intimate personal devotion and functional relationship. It is before the LORD that one can receive instructions and directions for each day to fulfill his/her destiny.

The Bible says in 2 Tim 2:15, **_&#8221;Do your best to present yourself before the LORD as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing/handling the word of truth._**&#8221; From this scripture, the Holy Spirit is saying to me that it is a personal responsibility to the best of my ability to ensure that &#8220;I present myself before the LORD.&#8221; God does not want things; God does not want tithes and excuses, but He needs my heart. And that the best approval is of GOD. But I must however present myself first before I can be approved unto GOD. The truth is that the best of man is man. The way I understand the word &#8221;present&#8221; is that I have to lay down my self-life; I have to bring self into captivity to the obedience of Christ. Mr. Self must be laid at the feet of the LORD i.e. I must voluntarily, deliberately surrender my self-will at the foot of the wondrous Cross. It also means that I must willingly deny myself; daily carry my cross; before I can be approved by God to be His true follower. It is God&#8217;s approval that counts and not man. The practical lesson here is that the Old man must be completely evacuated before the New Creation Man can rightly handle the Word of God.

King Ahasuerus came with the Old Creation Man lifestyle inherited from his ancestors, and you cannot expect him to do otherwise. But as for the believer, the Cross has happened, and hence we cannot afford to spend our days feasting and drinking. For the kingdom of God is not for drinking and eating; but for joy, peace, and righteousness in the Holy Spirit. It is your personal responsibility to daily find out what God would have you do in this body daily. You must diligently seek to know the will of God for you each day.

But this demands high commitment and devotion. Even as I remember the story of the borrowed axe, which got drowned in the sea; the LORD is reminding me that I should not forget that I am living daily on borrowed life; borrowed time; borrowed breath. Hence, necessity demands that I must not let my borrowed axe fall away in the water of this life. My axe must not be drowned by the worries, urges, anxieties, and societal evils of this present world; for alas, we are borrowed vessels for the end-time revival labour. I must ask the Holy Spirit to teach and train me on how to manage the kingdom&#8217;s economy and lifestyle with godly wisdom. We must not be wasteful and prodigal in lifestyle, like this pagan king who barely into the third year of his reign, organized 187 days of feasting and drinking!

Dearly beloved, I want you to know that no sane man will do things for no reason. So, as I study further in Chapter 1 of the book of Esther, it is fitting to find out why this king organized such a marathon feasting for the nobles and princes of his kingdom? King Ahasuerus was not being arbitrary for organizing such flagrant wasteful feasting and drinking for 187 days. He had a purpose which shall be uncovered.

Let us look into verse 4 and discover the reason for this waste. But for the benefit of context, let us read verses 3-4, **_&#8220;…that in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his officials and servants—the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces being before him— 4 when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendour of his excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days in all.&#8221;_**

As I look at verse three of chapter 1 of Esther, it is apparent that the reason behind this flagrant waste was &#8216;pride&#8217; and &#8216;ostentation.&#8217; Child of God, bear in mind that the root of the fall of Satan was pride and his audacious desire to challenge God. God hates a proud heart. It is fearful to know that pride is the root of sin. As I look at this story, I am appalled that barely three years into his tenure, this pagan king embarked on an ostentatious show of the glorious riches and splendour of his excellent majesty. This is rather a childish thing to do. I have a strong inclination that he had thought this through, and concluded that the only way he could consolidate his reign was to engage in this lavish feast. May I, therefore, draw our attention to the fact that there are practical lessons to glean from this narrative as believers.

At this junction, let me discuss a few godly practical lessons here. However, please permit me to state that it is imperative to know that even though God is not against our celebration, but not this type of wasteful arrangement. Even the Bible says that the kingdom of God is not for eating and drinking, but righteousness, joy, and peace in the Holy Spirit. As a householder in the vineyard of the Lord, you must be in right standing with Him. You must be a trusted steward of what God has committed to your hands. We are not to be devourers of the bread meant for men, but faithful stewards. As stewards in the house of faith, we are to give men the bread due to them in due season. But this was not so for this king. He rather abused the privilege of the treasure in his care. His action was nothing short of mismanagement of state funds and resources. A gateway to corruption and bribery.

But as for you, Child of God, to be a faithful steward requires wisdom and divine ability to carry out what is dutiful and entrusted to your care. It demands ownership, responsibility, accountability, and reward. However, this pagan king acted irresponsibly without question from his nobles and princes. For example, husband, do you know that your wife and children are entrusted into your hand by the Lord? Pastor, do you know that necessity lies upon you to shepherd the flock of God under you? Are you a wife and you are privileged to manage the family account, but you are mismanaging it? Are you a student, but you are not a prudent steward with your monthly allowance? The reality is that each of us will give account to the Lord about the affairs of our stewardship, however insignificant they may be. I see that the life of this pagan king is a stern warning to us today. Are you a wife reading this blog? God is saying to you that you must not keep quiet when you notice that your husband is becoming wasteful with his spending habits. You must first take the matter to God before raising it with him. And in speaking to your husband, do so in love and respect. Don&#8217;t attempt to fly off the handle and speak to him. Be certain to take it to the Lord in prayer on behalf of the family. You must not be a party to such waste. To ignore such wasteful spending will attract great consequences to the family.
