### The Mystery of the Gospel

#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION

God in His love gave us&nbsp;The&nbsp;Gospel as His own&nbsp;Divine instrument for changing men. We were all sinners, criminals and under the divine judgment of God to be sentenced to eternal death and total separation from God. But God the Father out of His great love sent God the Son-Jesus Christ to the earth in the likeness of human flesh to die for our sins. Jesus was born without sin (as we shall see in this outline); hence had no sinful nature.

But in order to&nbsp;fulfil&nbsp;the&nbsp;Will of the Father, He gave Himself as a&nbsp;Living sacrifice to save mankind from the power of sinful nature, self,&nbsp;Satan and the world system.

God did this by laying on Christ the iniquity of us all (Isaiah chapter&nbsp;53&nbsp;verse&nbsp;6 says …’_and the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hath laid on him the iniquity of us all’.)&nbsp;So, on the Cross Christ died for our sins according to the&nbsp;Scriptures;&nbsp;He was buried according to the scriptures, and on the third day, He arose from the grave according to the scriptures&nbsp;1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1 (KJV)&nbsp;&#8211;_**<u>This is the Gospel</u>**.

**Romans chapter 1 verse 16&nbsp;says:**_&nbsp;‘For I am not ashamed of the&nbsp;Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek’._

Here, Paul was not ashamed of the Gospel because it is God’s power to save men (whether Jew or Gentile). This gospel of Christ is the only comprehensive instrument and power that can deliver men from death to life in Christ Jesus, from sin to righteousness, from darkness to Light, from the bondage of the Old nature to the liberty of the New creature in Christ Jesus. No wonder in 1 Corinthians chapter 15: verse 1 Paul said, “**_For I delivered to you as&nbsp;<u>of first importance</u>…_**”.**&nbsp;(ESV)**

Therefore, this Bible Study outline should be of first importance to all who diligently seek the Lord in Spirit and in Truth. It is of first importance to as many who are serious of making eternal life. Who have become tired of being under the mercy and tyranny of sin, Satan, and sinful nature? Since this is of first importance, it is therefore imperative that of all the Christian doctrines and teachings, the most essential and fundamental Christian teaching to any ministry.

#### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PURPOSE OF THIS BIBLE OUTLINE

_The singular pertinent and clear purpose for this Bible study outline can be found in the word of Brother&nbsp;Paul according to Colossians chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;2-3&nbsp;says,&nbsp;“That their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .**Colossians chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;2-3&nbsp;says:**&nbsp;[For my concern is] that their hearts may be braced (comforted, cheered, and encouraged) as they are knit together in love, that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding, and that they may become progressively more intimately acquainted with and may know more definitely and accurately and thoroughly that mystic secret of God, [which is] Christ (the Anointed One).In Him all the treasures of [divine] wisdom (comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God) and [all the riches of spiritual] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden. (AMPC)_

It is my prayer that as you engage this outline you will be encouraged, strengthened, and enlightened in the inner man both to will, understand, and to do the&nbsp;Will of God. May you increase on all sides to the full riches of the glory of God in Christ Jesus. May the Holy Spirit illuminate your hearts and minds to the divine ways and purposes of God; even also to the hidden treasures stored up for you in Jesus name.

</ol>

**_THE MYSTERY OF THE GOSPEL_****&nbsp;i**s an absolute truth that incorporates every aspect of the scripture (Old and New Testament). It is centred on Christ teachings, the Christian faith and the teaching of the Apostles. It is the heartbeat of becoming like Jesus for as long as we keep on believing in it because it is the Truth.

The other name for the Gospel is the Good news. It simply means that when I was deep in sin and disobedience, God’s mercy finds me through the revelation of the Word of God and I personally saw the crucified and the glorified Christ, and what He has done to save me. It must always point to Jesus. Not any man.

Beloved, at the heart of the Good News stands the message of the atoning death and resurrection of Christ.

**Romans chapter&nbsp;5&nbsp;verses&nbsp;8-10&nbsp;says:**&nbsp;_But God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.&nbsp;(KJV)_

**_Romans chapter 6 verses&nbsp;5-11&nbsp;says_**_:&nbsp;For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:&nbsp;Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. &nbsp;For he that is dead is freed from sin. &nbsp;Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. &nbsp;For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,&nbsp;but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp;(KJV)_

This reveals that death, the death to self, sin, Satan and the world system is what gives birth to the life of Jesus Christ called&nbsp;**THE NEW CREATION MAN.** I must see Jesus being lifted up in my heart, therein I must see myself being nailed, beaten, pierced, died with Jesus the Man of Calvary. It is when this revelation dawns on me that the death of Christ can be activated upon my life in Mercy.&nbsp;

_Then said Jesus unto them, when ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. John&nbsp;chapter8&nbsp;verse&nbsp;28&nbsp;(KJV)_

More so, it also teaches us that without the Life quickening Spirit of God mankind would have continued to be under the sway of fear of death and sin. But thanks be to God who gives us victory through faith in Christ Jesus death and resurrection power!

There is something profound about the Christian teaching, whether in terms of its content, curriculum, methodology, communication, and objective. This profoundness is no other than the Power of the Gospel to change lives. Friends, whether you are a drunkard, fornicator, adulterer, robber, liar, idolater, abuser or effeminate, this Gospel is so powerful to change you and your sinful lifestyle.

**_Romans&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verse&nbsp;16&nbsp;says:&nbsp;_**_For I am not ashamed of&nbsp;**the&nbsp;Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth**; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. (KJV)_

This is so, because, it is not a marketing presentation, it is not a drama, not a discussion, a debate or argument. It is not a motivational speech or academic research findings. It is not a theory, not a hypothesis. It is the WORD OF GOD.&nbsp;**_It is_&nbsp;_the Mystery of the Gospel_**! It is powerful and effective. It is lifesaving and life-changing to those who believe and foolishness to them who are perishing.

This&nbsp;**_‘Mystery’_**&nbsp;was hidden from previous generations in the Old Testament by God but now,&nbsp;it&nbsp;has been revealed unto men by the Holy Spirit, that&nbsp;“**_CHRIST in You and I (earthly vessels), is the HOPE OF GLORY”!_**&nbsp;(**T_he&nbsp;Mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His&nbsp;Saints._**

‘_To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles:] which is Christ in you, the hope of glory).’&nbsp;Colossians chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verse&nbsp;26-27 (NKJV)._

According to 1 Timothy chapter 3, verse 16, the scripture says: “**_<u>And without controversy great is the&nbsp;Mystery of&nbsp;Godliness</u>_**”. For example: there is no contention, no debate, no argument, no another school of thought that ‘**_Great is the Mystery of the Gospel’!_**

As touching the Mystery of the Gospel, there is a Glory. This Glory is what can come to us if we so desire. This Glory we must diligently and deliberately seek in all our undertakings, not for ourselves, but for Christ Jesus who died, who was buried, who was raised and who ascended to Heaven in glory.

And this glory is not just evident in our sermon, not even when Christ is preached just as an abstract or as an objective truth but actually evident when&nbsp;**_<u>Christ in you</u>_**,&nbsp;**_becomes_**&nbsp;**_the Hope of Glory_**. It is this hearing, hearing, hearing the&nbsp;**TRUTH**, that spring up our faith in Christ Jesus. And when this truth is applied accordingly in our lives, then it becomes evident as Christ in you, the Hope of Glory.

Just like in the old generation, there were many mysteries, such as; mystery religions, mystery creed, mystery cults, some even believed in superstitions, galaxies, worship of sun, moon etc. So likewise, there are diverse mysteries today. The danger to all these strange mysteries is to regard the Mystery of the Gospel as one of them. Nevertheless, it has its mysteries (and we shall learn this in the outline). But it is not a superstitious belief like in the unknown god of Ephesus. Neither is it sentimental like New age or Eastern religion e.g. Yoga. For the truth is that, no one can deny how great is the Mystery of godliness.

_1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says: ‘And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.’ (KJV)_
