### Our Deliverance from the Flesh

#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has Jesus Freed us from the Power of the flesh?

<ul type="a">
  <li>
    <strong>Romans&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;8&nbsp;verse&nbsp;3&nbsp;says,&nbsp;</strong><em>for what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending&nbsp;His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</em><strong>&nbsp;(NKJV, KJV)</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Galatians chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;13-14&nbsp;says,&nbsp;</strong><em>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: &nbsp;That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&nbsp;</em><strong>(NKJV, KJV)</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

Having briefly highlighted the meaning, nature and few&nbsp;_activities_&nbsp;of the flesh, it is therefore very important to establish whether Jesus who came in the flesh has completely freed us from the power of the flesh. The Power of the flesh is in its ability to dictate to us what it wants us to do at will. It is the power that controls our senses, sights and reasoning. It is the power that makes us do what we do. It is the power that arouses in us the strength and desires that produces a harvest of sinful deeds that leads to death.

**_Please note: That sin as a principle, deploys its alluring potent power on the flesh to lure man to sin against God and His Word. So, it is important to establish at this point that, the actual power of sin is not in sin, but in its ability to ISOLATE AND TERMINATE a believer from the presence of the Lord. (study the whole of Genesis chapter 3 for further understanding)_**

Now, let us closely examine if Jesus has freed us from the power flesh, its activities and its control? Below are few texts to help our understanding.

**1**.&nbsp;**<u>Romans&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;8&nbsp;verse&nbsp;3&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</u>**“_For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God&nbsp;did&nbsp;by sending His Own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh,” (NKJV)._

As I discovered from this text, let us note that in an unregenerate man nothing good dwells in the flesh. The flesh is of death&nbsp;**(Romans chapter&nbsp;7&nbsp;verse&nbsp;1-24 KJV**) hence no man can be justified by the law or keeping any human standards through the flesh&nbsp;**(Galatians chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;11&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith._

**Romans chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;20&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.__&nbsp;KJV_

#### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things to Know:

Let it be clear that the Law can do all things. The Law here is the Truth; it is also holy; It is the Word of God. It is life-giving. t is not a letter. For the letter killeth but the Spirit giveth life.&nbsp;2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 6

It is not the law that was weak,but was rendered weak ‘**THROUGH’**&nbsp;the flesh. Hence, the law could not do anything. The fact is that, the Flesh by nature is intrinsically rebellious and stubborn. As briefly mentioned above. And so, makes the law- (_though holy and righteous_) weak. Please discuss the preposition&nbsp;**‘through’**&nbsp;in this verse and its implication on your own walk with God.

  * So, to a carnal man, the law of God is just a mere letter. And to such a carnal man, it lacks power and purpose to make him to obey the Will of God or receive divine supply of grace to meet divine demands of God. It is, therefore, as a result of the above that the law, appears seemingly incapable of pleasing God because of man attempt to keep the Law.&nbsp;**It is man’s fault and NOT God!**
  * The flesh is of sin, yet Jesus became flesh.&nbsp;_Nevertheless, Jesus was only in the ‘**likeness’&nbsp;**of the flesh and did not have the sinful nature of the flesh_.&nbsp;**(2 Corinthians chapter&nbsp;5&nbsp;verse&nbsp;21&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

Hebrews chapter&nbsp;4&nbsp;verse&nbsp;15&nbsp;says:&nbsp;For we have not a&nbsp;High priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin.**&nbsp;KJV, LB)**.

  * **_See it in the context of the bronze serpent as the form or likeness of the actual living serpent biting the people of God_**.&nbsp;**_(&nbsp;Deuteronomy chapter&nbsp;21&nbsp;verse&nbsp;18 -23 says_****_&nbsp;_****_:&nbsp;_**_If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; &nbsp;And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he dies: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. &nbsp;And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: &nbsp;His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;thy God giveth thee for an inheritance._

#### 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things to know

**a.) So how did Jesus become a sin for mankind?**&nbsp;Because Christ drank the cup of our iniquity

**2 Corinthians chapter&nbsp;5&nbsp;verse&nbsp;21&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_For God took the sinless Christ and poured into him our sins. Then, in exchange, he poured God’s goodness into us!&nbsp;**Living Bible**_

**Isaiah&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;53&nbsp;verse&nbsp;4-6&nbsp;says:**_&nbsp;Surely, he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. &nbsp;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. &nbsp;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth._

**_Luke_****&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;22&nbsp;verse&nbsp;42&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done_.&nbsp;**(****KJV)**, He became an embodiment of sin and was crucified in the flesh

**Colossians chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;verse&nbsp;22&nbsp;says:**_&nbsp;In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:_

**1 Peter chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;verse&nbsp;18&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:_

**Romans chapter&nbsp;6&nbsp;verses&nbsp;6-7&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with&nbsp;Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin.&nbsp;(**KJV)**_

**_Please discuss the implication of these texts in your group. Do you now believe that you have been delivered from the power and tyranny of sin and&nbsp;Satan? Or you still live in doubt of the reality of the completed work of Calvar_****y?**).

Thus, on the Cross Jesus judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, thereby destroying Satan (**Hebrews chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;14&nbsp;says:&nbsp;**_Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;&nbsp;(KJV)_

**Colossians chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;verse&nbsp;13-15&nbsp;****_says:&nbsp;_**_And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; &nbsp;And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it._

<ol type="i">

    At the same time, God condemned sin through the death of Christ in the flesh which was brought by Satan into man’s flesh. Hence, it is possible for us to walk daily in this body not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit by the help of the Holy Spirit.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the text in Romans&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;8&nbsp;verse&nbsp;3&nbsp;which says:&nbsp;<em>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</em>
