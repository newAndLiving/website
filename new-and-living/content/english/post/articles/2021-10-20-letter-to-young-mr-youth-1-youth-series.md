# 1       Dear Young Mr Youth

There are two peaks in life: the dream peak and the attainment peak.

The dream peak magnifies the attainment peak to make it real and pursuable.

But unfortunately minifies the valleys in between.

So, the youth is tricked to think that bright visions equal their achievement in life.

After dreams, comes the separating valley through which man must walk to the peak of the other.

Young Mr Youth, which peak are you at presently? Dream peak or attainment peak?

Shalom!
