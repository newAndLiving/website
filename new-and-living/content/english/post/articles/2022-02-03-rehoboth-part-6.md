  <strong>&#8220;&#8230;Rehoboth&#8230;&#8221;</strong>
</h1>

### **Anchor Text**: **Genesis 26:1-22, 23-30.**

There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.

The correlation between Abraham&#8217;s and Isaac&#8217;s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.

<h3 aria-level="1">
  <strong>Relentlessness in Rehoboth (Genesis 26:26-30)</strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
</h3>

<span data-contrast="auto">Nevertheless, a treaty with our enemy Satan and his territory, which we progress against, is our sworn enemy. As such, every activity – subtle or severe – is a fighting strategy. For example, see how Abimelech and his entourage lied that they have been good to Isaac (Genesis 26:29). So satan comes because, in the last days, Christ has granted him the liberty to use deception as a weapon for his warfare (</span><span data-contrast="auto">Matthew 24:24</span><span data-contrast="auto">).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Satan knows humanity tend to sweat less in safety. In a time of opposition, almost all Christians are spiritually awakened in times of resistance; because they solely depend on God to fight their battles. Sadly, convenience or plenty poses more danger to a Christian than times of comfort. In stressful times, Satan appeals less to us with subtlety. It is fire-for-fire. But in the restoration land, Satan, like Abimelech, often subtly canvases for an unequal-yoking in the name of a peace treaty. He doesn&#8217;t look for ways to assault light with darkness. Instead, he strives to merge light with darkness through deceit, through which he could subtly quench the light.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">We are never told to consider every appeal for peace and unity sake. If anything, the scripture bid not to be ignorant of the explosive and implosive devices of the wicked one. We were further instructed to cast down every imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ. Every temptation of Satan at us, every proposal of his, falls into this category. For example, in the time of fruitfulness, hypocrites like Annanias and Saphira made their way into the flock of the Lord&#8217;s sheep. While, Simon, the sorcerer, offered cash for power when the gospel had found its home in Samaria. Once enriched materially, the Israelites quickly slipped into idolatry. Almost after, not in battle, Samson found himself gravitating towards sexual immorality or defiance to his Nazarene vows. The story could have been different if David had been more careful in peace than in trouble. Solomon ended shamefully in idolatry because David had fought all the wars he should have fought before he ascended to power.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">We must test every approach for a peace pact. It must be proved by the fire of prayer and the suffocation of time. Rehoboth is a place of attraction and roomy space and will attract people with different motives. One may be tempted to make room for all without necessarily contacting the one who made room for one in Rehoboth. Therefore, caution needs to be taken. Hard stands may be of necessity. Keep raising the fences of Rehoboth as high as Jerusalem&#8217;s maybe worth a standard. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Likewise, we should know that diplomacy is disastrous and is more deceitful in peace than outright confrontation. We are only occupants of a recovered territory. Now that the Lord has empowered us, we will rule in the midst of our enemy until Christ returns. </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">However, note that the deceitful possessor – Satan – whom we ousted will not relent. Hence, we were bid by Paul not to undress after any fight. We are bid to do all to stand – fully armed – after every victory. So, brother, seek not yet repose, hear your guardian angel say, thou art in the midst of foes, watch and pray&#8230;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Now that we have arisen to shine, whichever king must come to the brightness of our rising must come adhering to the terms and conditions of He whose glory, like light, has arisen upon us.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

Shalom.

Every Blessing in Christ.
