#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gleanings from Matthew 25:14-21

* First and foremost, we are on a pilgrimage and we cannot afford to be distracted along the way.
* We have nothing of our own and we don&#8217;t own our self.
* We are bought at a price fully paid. We belong to the Lord.
* We are living a &#8216;borrowed life&#8217;, &#8216;borrowed time&#8217;.
* We have been equipped with talents and gifts – therefore no-one is graceless.
* We are steward and must be faithful in our labour to who has called us. For He is faithful.
* We are saved **not by** works but by Grace **unto** good works.
* We have no excuses to give to God
* Nothing can **STOP** us except our **SELF**:
* Our attitude
* Our choice
* We have been given appropriate resources, location for our task and pilgrimage on earth.
* God has these 3-things over us:
* Divine Ownership
* Divine Sovereignty
* Divine Providence
* Our calling and task are for an appointed time and place.
* We have a responsibility that demands accountability.
* We have one Lord, one God, one faith, one hope of calling, one Spirit and one baptism.
* We shall all face the judgement seat.
* We cannot deny we’ve not received gifts and calling from the Lord.
* There is a reward for our labour both here and – **Eternal Life** – (Joy of the Lord)!
* We can only grow and make eternal life by OBEDIENCE and FAITH.
* The opposite is DISOBEDIENCE and the reward is HELL
* It is not God who sends a man to hell, it is the CHOICE we make and attitude (MOTIVE) we display.
* Nothing done under the sun is hidden from God
* God sees and knows all things.
* God cannot be mocked and deceived because He is patient.
* Every man has a day of reckoning to give account of what is done in this body.
* We have no reason to envy one another. For unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of gifts of Christ Jesus.
* Whether your talent multiply, or grows. Whether you increase in depth, width, length or height – Be reminded that you are a servant! A living Sacrifice!
* The talents are to be put to use and not hoarded or hidden.
* The talents are for the benefits of mankind and profiting of the Kingdom of God.
* Wisdom is principal in the deployment of the talent. We must also not be wasteful.
* You don’t get to choose the moment of your service, arrival and departure on Earth, but you get to choose your legacy.
* Don’t just leave a will, leave a **Legacy** for life that fulfils the will of God.

**GRACE BE MULTIPLIED UNTO YOU.**
