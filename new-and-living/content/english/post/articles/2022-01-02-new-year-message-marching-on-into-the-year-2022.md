  <u>Marching</u><strong><u> on into the Year 2022</u></strong>
</h2>

**Texts: Numbers 21:1-9; Psalm 2:1-4.**

Life is a journey that is measured in time and season. And in the journey of life, there are contentions and challenges. Our pilgrims’ journey cannot be void of attacks, battles and rages from the enemy. If there is nothing good about your journey in life, the enemy will not trouble you. But because of the sacrificial death of Christ at Calvary, and because of the glorious inheritance that awaits you, then be ready for challenges and contentions from the kingdom of darkness.

Personally, I have discovered in the Bible that whenever God is on the move (when the children of the Lord are walking in obedience to the counsel of the Lord), the kingdom of darkness is always on the attack against the children of Light!

In this short passage, the Israelites marched towards the Promised Land. But in the usual manner, the enemy raised a hostile King Arad against them on the way. He fought against them and took away some of God’s children as captives. Is this not the way that Satan, sin, and self have taken captives of ignorant and innocent souls? Let me ask you, my dear friend, &#8216;Has Satan taken you captive in your thoughts and will? Are you currently a prisoner of your own conscience?

Friends, the first thing I want to draw your attention to is this: **‘****_Life is a battle, and we are called into a battle_.’** A battle of sovereignty, ownership and providence. But the battle is not ours, but the Lord’s. Battles of life have levels and degrees; hence, you must choose your battle wisely and remember to hand it over to the Lord. Friends, have you handed over the battle of your **‘****_self-life_’** to the Lord at the Cross?

Secondly, every battle begins in the heart. It is commonly said that the mind is the battlefield of all battles. And this is very true from a practical life experience. Therefore, it is expedient to charge you that you should diligently guard your hearts this year for therein lies the issues of life.

Thirdly, since the Lord is the mighty man in the midst of the battle, and that the battle is of the mind, then it is wise to hand over your mind to the Lord. He is the one who can contend with those who contend with you. Quick question, ‘What are you currently contending with, in your life?’ Sinful habits? Addictions? Mood-swing substances? Adultery? Lies? Gluttony? and so on and so forth.

Beloved, we have come to a convenient day, a season of open heaven and enlargement breakthrough. **The Year 2022** is a year of abiding, abounding and abundant fruitfulness. It is a year to continue to march on in our fruitfulness, despite the battles of uncertainties and insecurities that plagued the year 2021. We must, therefore, arise and keep marching on in righteousness, holiness, willingness and obedience.

We are now in the Day of His Power. Therefore, we must be filled with His fullness; be increasingly fruitful in manifesting His holy life to all; thereby bringing forth New Births to the Lord; with the determined purpose to raise them to become like Jesus through the process of concerted and cumulative discipleship!

**<u>NECESSARY GUIDEPOSTS TO MARCH ON WITHIN THE NEW YEAR</u>**.

  1. The first and foremost is to be born-again. So, my friend, before the Lord can fight for you, you must be on the Lord’s side. You must be a child of God. You must not be living in sin. The Holy Spirit must be living inside of you.
  2. Following this, you must be in a personal discipleship relationship with a person approved by the Lord. The goal is to become like JESUS! Discipleship is the key to abundant Christian living here on earth.
  3. You will also need the Fire of the Holy Spirit to keep you ablaze as an ignitable agent. Praying always without ceasing.
  4. _‘Then the people of Israel made this vow to the Lord’_: (Num. 21:2). This means that you must be in a progressive and cumulative functional intimate relationship with God. You must be a friend of God in prayer, communion, devotion and consecration.
  5. Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it _spring the_ issues of life. Put away from you a deceitful mouth. And put perverse lips far from you. (Prov. 4:23-24).
  6. Let your eyes look straight ahead. And your eyelids look right before you. Ponder the path of your feet. And let all your ways be established. (Prov. 4:25-26).
  7. You must bear about in your body (mind) the death of Christ (which was for victory), so that the life of Christ may also be revealed in your body. (2Cor.4:10)
  8. Daily live in humility and gentleness of Christ. Though you are in the world, ensure that you do not wage war as the world does. Always remember that your weapons of battle are not carnal, but mighty through God to pull down strongholds, casting down false arguments and every pretence that raises itself against the knowledge of God, and take captive ALL thoughts to the obedience of Christ. And be ready to punish all disobedience, once your own obedience is complete. (2Cor. 10:1, 3-6).
  9. _Looking_ unto the typified &#8220;_bronze serpent&#8221;_ on the pole. This ‘&#8217;_bronze serpent&#8217;_ &#8216;on the pole is a symbol of the crucified Christ on the Cross at Calvary. For you to look at the ‘&#8217;_bronze serpent&#8221;_ on the pole in the wilderness and be healed, takes faith and obedience. So, you must walk by faith and obedience to enjoy lasting victory in the Year 2022. You must keep looking unto Jesus (The Revelation of the Mystery of the Gospel) as a journey through the New Year 2022. (Num. 21:8-9; Heb. 12:2).
 10. Let nothing separate you from the love of God. _No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. **<sup> </sup>**For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord_. (Rom.8:37-39).

11. Give adequate attention to your personal spiritual training and development_. But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. (Jude 1:20-21)._

12. Remain strong and unstoppable in the Lord_. Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. (Eph. 6:10-11)._

In conclusion, you must not waste this day of His power in idleness and disobedience. No procrastination and presumption. You must keep marching on as holy militant soldiers of the Cross unto victory. You must be deliberate to take personal responsibility to sow and keep sowing until you experience a ‘**Rehoboth’**. Even after, you have experienced fruitfulness, you must never give up. “_For the womb of a barren woman never stop crying for a child!_” The Holy Spirit must impart upon you an unquenchable desperate hunger and thirst for His presence, wisdom, power, and soul-winning. An inner momentum for holy action.

#### It is my prayer that you will experience the great visitation like the day of the Pentecost in the book of Acts 2 where the Holy Spirit fell upon them all in the upper room like as a cloven tongue of fire. After which, the meeting place of their spirit-led prayer was filled with the Holy Spirit, and then they all went out to preach the Gospel with boldness. May the Lord work wonders in your life as you _‘_**_go’_** out and ‘_sow’_ in spirit, unto righteousness and in faith from church to church, house to house, city to city. May the Lord bring increase to His Word through your life and confirm it with signs, wonders and true repentance in Jesus name. Amen!
