This is the final part on the series on the steward&#8217;s responsibilities in times like this.  
Why don&#8217;t you take time to listen to this and the rest of the episode to glean wisdom on how God would have you as a shepherd to prepare your self and the flock under you ready for His glorious appearing? O friend, I can hear the midnight crier calling out; &#8220;Maranatha, Maranatha&#8221;! Be watchful and ready for the coming King! Are you ready? Shalom. The Lampstand Podcast.
