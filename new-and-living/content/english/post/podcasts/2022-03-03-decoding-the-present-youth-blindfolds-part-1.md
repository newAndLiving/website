  <strong><u>Decoding the Present Youth Blindfolds – Part 1</u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: 2 Cor. 4:4**

Have you been to youth team-building exercises, a youth camp or a child’s party? Have you been to any of these games spiced up with blindfolds as fun games? Do you remember playing the blindfold game looking for the treasure box with bottles scattered all around to stop you from getting to the finishing point?

Friends, this is a reality check of what the enemy subtly do to blindfold you from seeing the faithful Lord and Saviour.

Today, almost everything in the Bible has become fun and frenzy games. The biblical teaching of youth has become a fairy tale; hence the gods of this world have blindfolded the majority of the young persons. What a fanfare!

Please join Sister Aramide and me as we carefully decode the current youth blindfolds and proffer solutions to release them from the blindfolds.
