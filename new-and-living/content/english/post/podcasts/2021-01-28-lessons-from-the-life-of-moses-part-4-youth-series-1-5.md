Have you ever questioned how items you pick up from the stores are valued? What are the factors to consider when making an estimation on any item for sale or purchase?

If you have never given it a ‘rain check’, why don’t you come along and listen to this Part 4 on the lessons from the life of Moses and find out why it is important to place the right valuation on your inheritance? And do you know your inheritance at all?

Friend, would you gladly sacrifice prosperity for poverty? Honour for shame? Comfort for discomfort? Publicity for obscurity? The scripture says, ‘**_For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake (and my sake) He became poor_**…’

For Moses in Egypt, two things played out for him, **_Faith and Estimation_**. He also had three options but one to pick from. Guess what option he picked…?

Join Sister Busola in this engaging Part 4 of your preferred Lampstand Podcast to find out Moses choice. Shalom!
