**Faith!!** Is the heavenly currency to operate heaven on earth. But who can genuinely measure the exchange rate?

Can faith make all things possible? Can faith conquer in time of adversity? Can faith confront the world circumstances and contradictions?

What does faith work then? And how do I live by faith? In whom should my faith be? Which is better, to live by faith or to walk by sight?

So, to answer all these questions, why don’t you come along and find out how the things that are possible to God are equally 100% possible to whosoever **_have faith in God_**. Season’s Greetings. Shalom!
