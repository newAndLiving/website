  <strong><u>Staying On the Potter&#8217;s Wheel. (Part 1) </u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: Jeremiah 18:1-6**

Have you been to the Potter’s house? Have you seen the Potter at work on his wheel?

Does a clay have moral choice and dimension to instruct the Potter on how to shape it? You are the clay; God is the Potter!

But sin and satan have marred our lives, perforated the glory of many, and fractured the destiny of several great potentials.

Therefore, staying on the Potter’s wheel is vital to shaping and moulding your life after God’s divine pattern predetermined before creation for you to be a channel of blessing. God does not wish to cast anyone away but to place such persons on the Potter’s wheel and repeatedly remake them.

**So, join princess and me in this frank discussion to find out the necessity of staying on the Potter’s wheel.**

The Lampstand Podcast. (April 2022).

Shalom!
