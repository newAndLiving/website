How you can endure the present profaned and corrupt world by living above sin is the focus of this conversation with Bro. Femi?

Quick question; What do you consider as sacred, and of a great value in your life? Materiality or Eternity? Esau’s lack of total disregard for his birth right as the first-born son and for the divine blessing were acts of godlessness and carelessness. He failed to place right value for eternal life.

Esau simply lost sight of eternity because of temporary fleeting pleasure. He placed the cat before the mouse. He simply reversed divine order. Although, he sought it with bitter tears, but it was too late for repentance.

This episode taught us that those who reject divine inheritance through Christ because of worldly pleasure, will have only bitterness and sorrow in their future.

But my friend, here is the Good News, there is great chance for you to repent today. Listen to this Lampstand Podcast for how your situation can be turned around in Jesus name. Shalom!
