**CONVERSATION WITH PRINCESS**

Hi friends, have you ever been inspired? Do you have a budding desire to do something special like writing, need a jet pack to visit the moon, to start a research project like building a drone, do something uncommon, or see your dreams come true etc?

Do you desire to know more about the Kingdom of God and how to maintain a personal intimate relationship with Christ?

So, are you currently thinking about taking your faith seriously after several failures and setbacks? Then, you need to listen to this frank discussion with a young author and find out how the Lord helped her.

Someone once said that the journey of a thousand miles starts with a step, and that, if you ever stop to listen to every bark of the dogs on your way, you may never get to your destination. But, how true is this saying?

Every fire starts with a spark, but how do you turn the spark into an unquenchable fire? To find out, join Princess in this special conversation on **&#8220;How to keep your fire burning&#8221;**.

Friend, guess what? There is a window to your future that opens to you now that you are still young and the **Lampstand Podcast** is about to reveal to you how to put your perspective into a reality.

**Shalom!**
