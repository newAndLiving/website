Join Olivia and Amber in their quest for God as they analyze Matthew 6:33 with a young perspective. They looked at how to seek God&#8217;s Kingdom in times like this as the secret to abundant victorious living for the young person. Can God really add all other things as He has promised? Join us on The Lampstand-Podcast for more. Shalom!<figure></figure>
