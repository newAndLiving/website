The part 1 began with the question on whether anything in this world is free? Is there anything like free school meal or free education?

In the concluding part we would be looking at the meaning of Truth, and who is the Truth and why the Real Truth is absolute and not relative?

You are welcome on board &#8211; The Lampstand Podcast. Shalom!<figure></figure>
