  <strong><u>Decoding the Present Youth Blindfolds – Final Part</u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: 2 Cor. 4:4**

Hi Young Person,

Try and imagine being in the same car with a blindfolded driver? What do you think will be the consequence to you and him? I leave you to answer that.

Have you a desire for self-independence? Yearning to be alone and in control? Are you currently blind to the truth because of your rebellion? Is your blindfold carnal affection, hypocrisy, negativity, apathy and presumptuousness?

Do you assume you have it under control? That may be a deception from the evil one.

Please join us as we carefully identify godly ways by which these blindfolds can be removed from their faces.

The Lampstand Podcast. (2022).

Shalom!
