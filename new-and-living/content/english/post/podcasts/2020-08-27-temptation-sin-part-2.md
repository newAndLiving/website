With many choices flashing at us today like a Formula 1 race car, it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to resist the fluidity of adverts from running in their mileages right before our faces.

In this Episode of Temptation, it is appropriate to ask these questions, &#8220;Is there any association between Temptation and Sin? Is Temptation sin? and who is the Tempter? God or Satan?&#8221;

Please join us as we carefully search the Scriptures to get answers to these questions. Shalom
