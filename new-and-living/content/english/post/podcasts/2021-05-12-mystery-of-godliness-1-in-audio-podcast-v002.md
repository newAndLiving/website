## **The Central Purpose**

The central pertinent purpose for this Bible study outline in podcast version can be found in the word of Brother Paul according to Colossians chapter 2 verse 2-3.

It says: (For my concern is] that their hearts may be braced (comforted, cheered, and encouraged) as they are knit together in love, that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding.

And that they may become progressively more intimately acquainted with, and may know more definitely, and accurately, and thoroughly that mystic secret of God, (which is] Christ (the Anointed One).

In Him, all the treasures of [divine] wisdom (comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God), and [all the riches of spiritual] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden. (AMPC)
