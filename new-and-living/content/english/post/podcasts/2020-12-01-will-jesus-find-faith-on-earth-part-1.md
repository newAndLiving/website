Yen is to Japan. Naira is to Nigeria. Rand is to South Africa. Sterling is to the United Kingdom. There are 195 countries in the World today, each having her own currency. The last time I checked, none of them can get you to heaven. I stand to be corrected!

Do you wonder whether there is Heavenly currency? Have you seen it? Is it acceptable as a medium of exchange here on earth? What is this Heavenly currency given to believers to trade with here on earth?

And what is the implication of this timely question that Jesus posed to His disciples? **_Will the Son of Man when He comes find faith on the earth?_**

Join Bro. Tony and I as we actively discuss the answer to Jesus question on this Podcast-The Lampstand. Shalom!
