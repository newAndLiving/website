In a frank conversation with a Pastor friend, we closely looked at the most important Christian virtue for service and fellowship with one another.

This Godly virtue is almost fading away in the believer’s community today. We considered what the reason is and proposed solution to it so that we can rebuild a holistic believers&#8217; community once more.

This is a concluding part of a conversation with Bro. Tony.
