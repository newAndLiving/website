Georgia and Gina were twins. They so identical such that only their mum knew them apart (not even their dad).

While Georgia was well behaved of the twins, Gina was the opposite. She was the troublesome one. And the two girls grew &#8230;.

Why don&#8217;t you join us in this episode of The Lampstand and learn more about the two girls? Shalom!
