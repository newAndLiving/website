Have you ever sat down and thought about the conversation between Eve and the Serpent in Genesis 3:1-6? Who do think she was having conversation with? Is there any link between the Serpent and the Old dragon who deceives mankind? This is a continuation from Part 4.

Join us in this next series on the association between Temptation and Sin as we looked at the unusual conversation between the woman and the serpent in the garden of Eden. Shalom!
