Zara wanted a new phone because the current one had a smashed screen, a broken camera and the battery life was poor.

She didn&#8217;t just want a phone; she needed one very fast. but she didn&#8217;t know who to ask and what to do because she was a student and couldn&#8217;t afford one by herself?

Why don&#8217;t join us in this short Podcast story about Zara to find out how she got a brand new smart phone?
