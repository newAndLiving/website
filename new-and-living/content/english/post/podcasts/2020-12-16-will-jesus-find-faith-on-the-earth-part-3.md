Recently, someone told me that a part-time Christian can not defeat a full-time Devil. Can this be true statement? Do you wonder what this is all about?

What are the signs of the last days to watch out for, so that you don’t fall away?

In this world of convenience and ease, how can you practically engage in soul winning without recourse to discouragement, opposition and fear of past failure or being called a fanatic?

How many will Jesus find on the earth who are still faithful? Will He find you faithful, will He find me faithful? Find out in the final part of this episode titled- **_Will Jesus find faith on the earth?_** Shalom!
