Hi Friends,

I have a quick question for you? Do you think that the Earth came by Evolution or Creation?

Whether you are Christian or not, what do you believe?

Did God exist before the beginning or after the beginning?

Does God know the end from the beginning? Did He create Heaven and the Earth? Or was it just a fluke?

Why don&#8217;t you listen to this episode on the Transforming Power of The New Creation Life to Know more about GOD and His creation?
