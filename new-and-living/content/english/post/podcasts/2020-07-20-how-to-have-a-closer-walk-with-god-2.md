This is the concluding part of how to walk in a closer relationship with the Lord. God is more than a friend and life to us. He is closer to us than our breath. So, in our pilgrimage on this earth, we need to stay closer to Him than even our loved ones.  How does a child of God develop an intimate functional relationship with the Lord in this busy and microwave generation? How can a believer have a closer walk with God in this jet pack, warm and frenzy generation of hi-tech and mileage of social media platforms?  In answer to these questions, join me as you listen. Shalom
