**CONVERSATION WITH PRINCESS**

Hi Precious Friends,

This is the final part of my frank conversation with Princess. There are millions of authors out there whose inner life is incongruent with their books. But in this podcast session, I have found Princess young life with a difference.

In this final part, she shared with me her strong point. And guess what that is? It is her personal intimacy with the Lord. She revealed that the most important ingredient to keep your fire burning is nothing but an unbroken and blended relationship with the Holy Spirit.

So, if you are struggling with that in your private life, why don&#8217;t you take time out and patiently listen to this concluding part of my frank conversation with her? You&#8217;ll be glad you did. It will certainly transform your life inside out and renew you to be like the New Creation Man.

Do you desire to know more about the Kingdom of God and how to maintain a personal intimate relationship with Christ?

Whether you are cold, sullen or furlong in your personal life, academics, relationship with God, friends, family etc, you have the real chance to get back to the presence of the Lord where your life will experience a fresh revival and transformation. Someone once said that the journey of a thousand miles starts with a step. Then, step on it today!

Every fire starts with a spark, but how do you turn the spark into an unquenchable fire? To find out, join Princess in this final conversation on “How to keep your fire burning”.

My friend, there is a window opened to you via **the Lampstand Podcast.** **God bless you**.

**Shalom!**
