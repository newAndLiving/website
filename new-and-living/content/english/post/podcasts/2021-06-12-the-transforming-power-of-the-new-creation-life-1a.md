Hi Friends,

Quick question? Evolution or Creation; What is your conviction? Quiet or Confident?

Did God exist before the beginning or after the beginning?

Does God know the end from the beginning? Did He create Heaven and the Earth? Or it was just an idea?

Why don&#8217;t you listen to this episode on the Transforming Power of The New Creation Life to Know more about GOD and the work of His hands?
