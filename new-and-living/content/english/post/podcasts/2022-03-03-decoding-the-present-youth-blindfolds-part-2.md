  <strong><u>Decoding the Present Youth Blindfolds – Part 2</u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: 2 Cor. 4:4**

While growing up, I once lived in an environment where I thought rascality and vices were acceptable ways of life. But, when I finished elementary school and moved out to further my academic pursuit, I discovered that my immediate environment blindfolded me.

A blindfold deprives a person of sight by covering their source of vision. I could have refused to give serious attention to my education and the Word of God! If not for the mercy of God, I could have gone the wrong way.

Hey, young man/woman, are you currently blindfolded by your environment, euphoria, desire for self-esteem, the quest for self-independence and social media cravings? Then, this edition of the Lampstand Podcast is ideal for you.

So, join Sister Aramide and me to glean lessons from her life experience, inspired wisdom and godly counsel for your destiny.

The Lampstand Podcast. (2022).

Shalom!
