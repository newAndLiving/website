In this final part, if**_ having faith in God_** is the secret key that God has provided for mankind to make God’s possibilities available to man, what then might be the pitfalls to look out for, so that we don’t make a shipwreck of our **faith in God?**

Do you hold anything against anyone? Do you find it difficult to experience the invisible visibly in your life? Do you know that, to **_have faith in God_** is contrary to our human way of thinking?

So, why don’t you come along in the final part of this Christmas edition, and discover what are the few hinderances to **_having faith in God _**_and how to overcome them_? Shalom! 🌟🌟
