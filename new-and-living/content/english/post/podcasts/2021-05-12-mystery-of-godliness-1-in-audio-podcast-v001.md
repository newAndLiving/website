God in His love gave us The Gospel, as His own Divine instrument for changing men.

We were all sinners, criminals, and under the divine judgment of God to be sentenced to eternal death and total separation from God.

But God the Father, out of His great love sent God the Son, Jesus Christ to the earth in the likeness of human flesh, to die for our sins.

Jesus was born without sin (as we shall see in this outline); hence had no sinful nature.

But in order to fulfill the Will of the Father, 

He gave Himself as a Living sacrifice, to save mankind from the power of sinful nature, self, Satan, and the world system.

God did this, by laying on Christ the iniquity of us all, (Isaiah 53: 6) says …’ _and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all._

So, on the Cross Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;

He was buried according to the scriptures and on the third day,

He arose from the grave according to the scriptures;

1 Cor. 15:3-4(KJV)
