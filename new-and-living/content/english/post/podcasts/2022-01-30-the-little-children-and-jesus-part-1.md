  <strong><u>The Little Children and Jesus (Part 1) </u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: Matthew 19:13-15**

Some brethren went on outreach and returned with the report, ‘saying that the Lord saved three and a half-soul, but the man of God responded, ‘what do you mean by three and a half souls were saved? Those three adults are halves while the child is one wholesome’. He reminded them that those three adults were probably nearing the end of their lives, but this young one had a more splendid future ahead of him.

What is your relationship like with your children, fathers, mothers, grandparents, guardians, and leaders out there? Are you a friend to your child or a terror? Interestingly, if Jesus could relate with little children with compassion and love, and sparing time to bless them, then you have no excuse at all. So, get connected with your children!

In this episode of the Lampstand Podcast, join Gbenga and Bro. Tony, to know more about the mystery of Jesus and the little children.
