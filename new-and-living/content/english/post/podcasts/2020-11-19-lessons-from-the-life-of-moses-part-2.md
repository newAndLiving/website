In this Part 2, we closely looked at how critical is the lesson of having clear identity both for life and godliness. 

Dear young Person, quick question, do you wish to be exceptional in life? Then, note that these points are vital to having a unique identity. And they are; Your Premise, Your Position and Your Privileges.

Today, many Young Persons are practically going through a difficult period of Identity crisis, hence, they can not cope with the peer pressure confronting them.

So, in this Part 2 with Sister Busola, we were prompted to discover that Identity crisis could be either internal or external. And that faulty foundational upbringing causes identity crisis among the Young Persons.

And what might the solution be? Just click the play and find out. Shalom!
