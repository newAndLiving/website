In this episode which will come in parts, is the frank conversation on lessons from the life of Moses who refused to be known ‘_as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter’_.  But chose to be mistreated along with the people of God.

This frank discussion on lessons from the life of Moses, reveals three main issues you must come to terms with in order to succeed in life, even in a foreign land no matter your colour, name, race, background, accent and faith.

Moses had every comfort he could ever wish for in the palace, and he could have stayed there. But he refused and chose the way of suffering for God’s sake.

O, Young Person out there, what would you have done? Would you have lost your **Identity,** **Responsibility**, **Estimation** and **Choice**? Or preserve them in the Egypt-Today&#8217;s World?

To get more answers to these questions, why don’t you join Sis. Busola in this frank conversation on instructive lessons from the life of Moses-The Egyptian Prince who became God’s Servant? Shalom!
