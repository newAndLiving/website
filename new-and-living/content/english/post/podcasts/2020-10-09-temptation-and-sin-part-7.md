The sin of unbelief is a serious one before the Lord. Millions of people perished in the wilderness because of it.&nbsp;

Mankind becomes victim of unbelief when they mistrust or distrust the Lord and His Word. It is on this foothold that the tempter preys on the vulnerable people to make them to sin against God.

Join on in this episode as we look at Heb. 3:7-11. Shalom!
