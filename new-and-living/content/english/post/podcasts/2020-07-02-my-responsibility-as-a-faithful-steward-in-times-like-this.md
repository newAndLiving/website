As we drift further into the end of time, and with the unprecedented effects of the present global health crisis, it is timely and imperative for us to refocus our time and energy on preparing for the second coming of Our Saviour and Lord Jesus.

We shall be considering few parables, prophecies and epistles inthe Bible to remind ourselves of what our utmost responsibility should as faithful stewards.

Why don&#8217;t you join me on THE LAMPSTAND Podcast? Shalom!<figure></figure>
