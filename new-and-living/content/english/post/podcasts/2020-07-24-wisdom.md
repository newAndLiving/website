Join Jayden and Jaylene in their quest for wisdom as we briefly analyse Pro.2:6-8.&nbsp; So, how can a Young Person seek God&#8217;s wisdom and understanding in times like this? How can they live a victorious Christian life over sin and temptation around them?

This is explained in a short narrative of your preferred podcast-The Lampstand. Shalom!<figure></figure>
