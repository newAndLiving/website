In this episode, we closely looked at the three gateways by which men get tempted. I am sure it will surprise you!

Nevertheless, it is interesting to know that these gateways are parts of our bodies. If you would like to find out, why don&#8217;t you join us to know more about how these gateways give way to sin?

You will be blessed you did. Shalom!
