**TIME TO TALK… SOCIAL ISSUES**

In this Time to Talk session between Samuel and Judah, the focal discussion point was on how a young man can keep himself pure and uncontaminated from sin and societal evils.

And why suffer identity crisis when you have strong Christian family values? But at what point does a godly raised child deviate from godliness into crime, gang culture and drugs? What are the pressure points that you daily encounter as a young person as you interact with others in the community?

And how would you rise above these temptations and pressures daily?

To answer all these questions, click on **the Lampstand Podcast** and listen to Samuel and Judah as they shared their experiences and tips for victorious living in a fallen world.

**Shalom!**
