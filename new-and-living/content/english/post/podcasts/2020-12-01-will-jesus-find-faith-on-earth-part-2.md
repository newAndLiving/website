This is the Part 2 of the question Jesus asked His disciples in Luke 18:8. **_When the Son of Man comes will He find faith on the earth?_**

Jesus did not give an answer to this question. He expects us to give answer to this question by our Word, Life, Love, Truth and Purity.

How does faith come? What is faith? Why is it imperative for us to live by faith? Is faith a currency acceptable in the world? How will it prepare me for eternity? Will the Son of Man come at all as He has promised?

So, for you to remain faithful through trials, perils, persecution, tribulation, health crisis that will precede the coming of the Son of Man, you will need one thing ….!

Find out in this Part 2 of this active conversation the answer to Jesus million-dollar question. Shalom!
