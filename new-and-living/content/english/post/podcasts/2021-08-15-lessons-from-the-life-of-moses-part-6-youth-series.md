The issue of Choice is common to all mankind. Choice of fashion, music, crime, career, university, friends etc. But at what point and for what reason do you make a choice? Do you still sit on the fence of indecision? What pleasure of sin are you meddling with? Pornography? Sexual immorality, drug, alcohol?

Do you know that, Moses, while in Egypt made a choice of a lifetime? Have you taken a decision that was contrary to the fact/proof before? What was the outcome?

In this final episode, Moses made a choice lifetime based on his Identity and Estimation.

So, are you about to make a choice of a lifetime? Then, join Sis. Busola and Gbenga in this Lampstand Podcast for tips on Choice making.

Shalom!
