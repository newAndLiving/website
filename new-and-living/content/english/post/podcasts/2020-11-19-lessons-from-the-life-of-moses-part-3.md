Here, in part 3 of this Lockdown Episode on the Life of Moses in a difficult time in Egypt, we discovered the immense benefits of modelling Christ into the life of the child and the Young Person in their prime time.

But we soon concluded that for this to be possible, the guardian, parent must also have Christ. You can not give what you don&#8217;t have? Think on this?

We also saw that children and Young Person are quick to forget their godly heritage and family values.

So, what do you think could account for all these? Why don&#8217;t you come along with us on this episode with Sist. Busola? Shalom!
