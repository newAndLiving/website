Hi Friends,

**<u>PEER PRESSURE</u>**

**Have you ever been under the influence of peers, friends or family? Do you ever do some things because â€˜my friends do it?&#8217; Do you have a clear opinion about things, or are your opinions always based on what your friends and family think, not what you actually think or God is saying to you?**

**If so, this podcast session is for you. Join Gbenga, Tomi and Tireni as they discuss peer pressure and share their experiences, and how they are gradually overcoming it.** 

**They analysed the meaning and delved into godly Christian counsel about the topic.** 

**Also mentioned are Bible scriptures perfect for helping you in the time of test and trouble.**

**The Lampstand Podcast. Shalom!**
