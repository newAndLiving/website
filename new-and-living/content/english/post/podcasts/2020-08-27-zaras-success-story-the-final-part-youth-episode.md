Zara is now 20 years old. She now has a flourishing pastry and confectionery business. She started out with no wisdom and direction in the way to go.

But when she turned to the Lord, He gave her wisdom and favor for she trusted in Him. Once, a customer came into her cake shop, and asked her how she became successful? Zara replied, &#8220;To God be the glory&#8221;.

Join us in this final episode and celebrate Zara success. The Lampstand. Shalom!
