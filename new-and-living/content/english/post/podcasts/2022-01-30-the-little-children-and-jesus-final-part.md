  <strong><u>The Little Children and Jesus (Final Part) </u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: Matthew 18:5-6, &10**

The Kingdom of God is real. It is incorruptible and imperishable. So, how come only these little ones who trust in the Lord can enter into it?

Spiritually, what does the “little Children” designation emphasize in this text? Does it mean that only the believing adults who believe in Christ can enter the Kingdom?

Is Jesus referring to the kingdom lifestyle or something else? Is the thought of this frightful to you if you refuse to be like these _little ones_?

In this final part of “_The little children and Jesus_,” please listen to the frank conversation between Gbenga and Bro. Tony for better insight.
