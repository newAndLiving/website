  <strong><u>Who is the Christ to a Young Person? – Part 1</u></strong>
</h2>

**Anchor Text: Luke 9:18-23**

If asked, do you know who your father is? What would be your response? I bet you will dismiss the question as a joke.

In this episode, Jesus asked His disciples (not the crowd) who do people say I am? He wanted to find out whether they knew Him as a message, miracle worker, bread giver, or they had a personal revelation of His person, character and life. It seems that the time with Him has changed their opinion about Him.

Has your perspective of Christ as seen in your pastor, leader, parents and teachers been an audio-visual aid to your understanding of who Christ is?
