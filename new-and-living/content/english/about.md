## Our Mission

Majority in the church and Christian fellowship within their hearts long to know God intimately, personally and functionally. They are seeking to possess Him as their only treasure both for life and godliness. They passionately desire that God becomes their only desire, pleasure and treasure.

Hence, they are asking questions; how can these things be? What has God provided for mankind to know and walk with Him intimately in this Way? They reason that there is a yonder to knowing God beyond the pulpit.
Here, for us as well, we have discovered there is no substitute to growing in the faith and grace unless we place a premium on our pursuit of knowing God in the new and living Way.

So, our mission is to take the Mystery of the Gospel beyond the pulpit, beyond fellowship and beyond regular meetings to everyone via this platform. We strongly believe that through this medium many will have a direct encounter with God, personally know Him, and learn how to develop an intimate personal and functional relationship with Him alone.

## Our Vision

This ‘Mystery’ was hidden from previous generations in the Old Testament by God but now, it has been revealed unto men by the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, that “CHRIST in You (earthly vessels), is the HOPE OF GLORY”! (The Mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His Saints.‘To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles:] which is Christ in you, the hope of glory’) (Col.1:26-27).

This one thing, we will pursue until everyone come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect (complete and mature) man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. (Ephesians 4:13).
