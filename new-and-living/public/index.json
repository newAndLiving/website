Several characters in the Bible could not have been able to share their life experience with us if they did not encounter the Lord. At different times, places, and circumstances, they came into unscheduled collision with God before He became the sole precedence in their life. The counteraction they came against with God became their platform of accomplishment in life. Perhaps, your own life will encounter the Rock of Ages as you read this. And may the Lord grant clear and bright illumination to your heart in every aspect in Jesus’ name.\nI have had several trials and tests, either directly or personally. God cannot spare you from these encounters if you want your precious life to amount to anything in the hands of the Lord.\nGenuine experience affects the judgment or feelings produced by any event. These events may be either witnessed or participated in everyday life. My motivation, however, in this write up is to focus on the careful process of divine encounter and its implication on a man’s life.\nIt is not a random occurrence for a person to experience the Lord. But a direct and definite one with a clear beginning (place) and enduring progress. Given this, a child of God cannot affirm a concrete encounter without an open meeting, which means no encounter, no experience!\nA divine encounter is direct contact with God. So, when a child of God has a forceful collision with God, they experience a complete loss or change of their opinion, standard, ideology and direction. Do you have a testimony to this effect?\nMost men who encounter God experience a violent encounter. You will agree that none of us was born a friend of God. The Bible says, ‘…While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.’ Rom 5:8. So, an encounter is a counteraction and not a parallel action. Two parallel lines cannot meet. Given this, for a genuine child of God, a constant counteraction with God is an everyday experience for spiritual maturity and stability.\nAs we take a quick look at the narrative about Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10, it is my prayer that you will encounter the Lord and experience a lasting counteraction against anything in your life contrary to the Lord in Jesus’ name.\nThe first intricate matter of note in this short narrative about Zacchaeus is that ‘Life’ is a journey. We set about on various trips and plans in our daily living, arranged multiple meetings, and set out for one business or the other. However, in the course of all these, we experience unplanned counteraction. Such incidental actions set us in collision with the Lord! And the outcome of this encounter with the Lord will either permanently bless us or permanently damage us.\nA few years ago, I set about on a holiday journey to the US. I took along a particular book to read on the flight. The book was titled, ‘When the Heavens are closed’. As I started with the introduction, I could not stop but read on. I could barely eat something before I got to my destination. The holiday was for two weeks visiting three different states, but friends, I couldn’t even go past the spare room my cousin lodged me. My two weeks holiday turned into a personal retreat. My host could not comprehend why I refused to visit places and friends.\nDuring my time in my cousin’s house, I uniquely experienced the Lord. Bear in mind that I did not plan for a retreat at all. The supposedly planned holiday visit turned out to be a counteraction against my will, way, and plan. In this default retreat, I experienced God in an extraordinary way beyond my expectation. Indeed, an encounter of a lifetime. It was a forceful collision with my own will and plan. It collided with my desired schedule such that I experienced a permanent destiny transformation. This lifetime change is now a blessing to me.\nFriends, this is the kind of encounter I am discussing with you—a lifetime counteraction against everything that is not wholly pleasing and acceptable unto the Lord.\nYou will agree with me that Zacchaeus was about his business when he suddenly met a huge crowd surrounding Jesus. And this became a sort of wonder and attraction to him. Hence, he could not wait for the vast group because he was of short stature. So, by instinct, he ran before and quickly climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Christ, for He was passing through that way.\nAlthough Zacchaeus was rich, very popular, and was the chief among the tax collectors, he still had a need. He was not complete without an encounter with the Lord. Zacchaeus’s life was empty. His ways were not acceptable to the Lord. He knew in his own heart that there was an emptiness and unrest. Imagine such a wealthy man, yet heavy laden and full of trouble. So, my friend, as you read this, let me ask you what the condition of your life is? Complete or incomplete? Are you confused or at peace? Can you boldly say you have experienced the Lord Jesus as your personal Lord and Saviour? Can you point to a spiritual encounter with Him? For where there is no encounter, there can be no experience. No cross, no glory. No scar, no star!\nShalom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\n‘GBENGA AKINDELE {GA}.

There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.\nThe correlation between Abraham’s and Isaac’s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.\nRelentlessness in Rehoboth (Genesis 26:26-30)  Nevertheless, a treaty with our enemy Satan and his territory, which we progress against, is our sworn enemy. As such, every activity – subtle or severe – is a fighting strategy. For example, see how Abimelech and his entourage lied that they have been good to Isaac (Genesis 26:29). So satan comes because, in the last days, Christ has granted him the liberty to use deception as a weapon for his warfare (Matthew 24:24).\nSatan knows humanity tend to sweat less in safety. In a time of opposition, almost all Christians are spiritually awakened in times of resistance; because they solely depend on God to fight their battles. Sadly, convenience or plenty poses more danger to a Christian than times of comfort. In stressful times, Satan appeals less to us with subtlety. It is fire-for-fire. But in the restoration land, Satan, like Abimelech, often subtly canvases for an unequal-yoking in the name of a peace treaty. He doesn’t look for ways to assault light with darkness. Instead, he strives to merge light with darkness through deceit, through which he could subtly quench the light.\nWe are never told to consider every appeal for peace and unity sake. If anything, the scripture bid not to be ignorant of the explosive and implosive devices of the wicked one. We were further instructed to cast down every imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ. Every temptation of Satan at us, every proposal of his, falls into this category. For example, in the time of fruitfulness, hypocrites like Annanias and Saphira made their way into the flock of the Lord’s sheep. While, Simon, the sorcerer, offered cash for power when the gospel had found its home in Samaria. Once enriched materially, the Israelites quickly slipped into idolatry. Almost after, not in battle, Samson found himself gravitating towards sexual immorality or defiance to his Nazarene vows. The story could have been different if David had been more careful in peace than in trouble. Solomon ended shamefully in idolatry because David had fought all the wars he should have fought before he ascended to power.\nWe must test every approach for a peace pact. It must be proved by the fire of prayer and the suffocation of time. Rehoboth is a place of attraction and roomy space and will attract people with different motives. One may be tempted to make room for all without necessarily contacting the one who made room for one in Rehoboth. Therefore, caution needs to be taken. Hard stands may be of necessity. Keep raising the fences of Rehoboth as high as Jerusalem’s maybe worth a standard. \nLikewise, we should know that diplomacy is disastrous and is more deceitful in peace than outright confrontation. We are only occupants of a recovered territory. Now that the Lord has empowered us, we will rule in the midst of our enemy until Christ returns. \nHowever, note that the deceitful possessor – Satan – whom we ousted will not relent. Hence, we were bid by Paul not to undress after any fight. We are bid to do all to stand – fully armed – after every victory. So, brother, seek not yet repose, hear your guardian angel say, thou art in the midst of foes, watch and pray…\nNow that we have arisen to shine, whichever king must come to the brightness of our rising must come adhering to the terms and conditions of He whose glory, like light, has arisen upon us.\nShalom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\nOdun Rotimi {OD}.

Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.\nRestoration (Genesis 26:22)   “Hope deferred makes the heart sick,” said that realistic expression in Proverbs 13:12, “But desire fulfilled is a tree of life.” The Chapter opens with famine, followed by a forbiddance to progress to Egypt in pastures green. Due obedience met with rejection and stiff resistance, livestock-, irrigation-, and life-sustaining wells were stumped. Isaac was disgracefully ushered out of the Philistine Capital, Gerar, like a traitor. From living in kingly quarters in Gerar, He descended to living in the abandoned valley of Gerar. Not even the epileptic Philistines lived there. While proceeding to the suburb, Isaac’s servants were waylaid in two other towns. Here if the Philistines needed water, they so needed to travel. Yet, the mileage did not discourage them from this journey because of sheer envy.\nAll these put together if Isaac had no personal relationship with God and a vivid example of hIs father’s walk with God, should have made him falter. I would have been tempted to doubt and despair. Many like me would have doubted God’s voice, saying, “Did I really hear God say…? or it might just have been a mere dream! Maybe I fabricated it.” What an example of faith Isaac was demonstrating. He knew Abraham to have known God to be He who calls things that be not as though they were. He anchored His trust on that. And this defied the blast of persecution and pressure with strength divine.\nHave you passed through a challenging time? How long? Years, Decades? We would not know. For the first time, after a series of struggles and displacement, He got to a land of “No opposition.” I perceive the more wells Isaac dug and were filled, the farther away he moved from the Philistines even while in their territory. Perhaps he was progressing farther and farther to a place beyond their reasonable or coverable reach or places where they would have tagged wasteland. If true. The farther away from them Isaac journeyed, the closer he came to the land of abundance. Little wonder, on reaching Rehoboth, a land devoid of opposition, He progressed to Beersheba since He was out of reach of these cruel Philistines. Friend, who is your cruel Philistines? No matter who they are, count it all joy! James 1:2\nRebehoth, to Isaac, was a tree of life. _“Because he said, ‘For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be **fruitful** in the land.'” Although he had once *“reaped in the same year a hundred folds,”*_ he knew there was more to God’s promise. And the realization of Rehoboth – the roomy space, devoid of quarrelling – was an assurance that God was at work. It was fruitfulness as a reward for destitution. It was blessings over scarcity. It was a life of peace of dispute. It is a place of freedom of expansion as the need arose. \nRehoboth was a place where those who envied him before and displaced him now beg to live at his mercy. It is a place where naturally his fame went abroad, even faster than when he was a next-door neighbour to Abimelech. It is a place where those who monitored him to his woe will be surprised at the wonder God attained through him. Those who anticipated evil will jaw-drop to see what God can do. It is a place where kings saw Isaac’s light shining in the darkness, with plenty in famine and safety in trouble. And they arise and come _“to the brightness of” his *“rising.”*_\nThe tides turned at Rehoboth, and every forward direction that Isaac went was blessed. The gentile king and his cabinet had to come to kiss this prince lest he mobilizes his aggrieved servant to take possession of the land of Philistine. They were in danger now! There is ample space for blessing, expansion and training for war now. The best political decision Abimelech could come to was to mobilize his famished army to beg for safety. May you experience such a fulfilling testimony too by God’s grace.\nI pray soon that all your years that has been eaten up by cankerworm shall be restored in Jesus name. Then the joy that ousts pain can be known and enjoyed, as did Isaac. Amen!\nShalom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\n","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2022-02-03-rehoboth-part-5/","title":"“…REHOBOTH…” (Part 5)"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"\u0026#8220;\u0026#8230;Rehoboth\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;  Key Text: Genesis 26:1-22 There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God.

Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.\nRetour   Resistance can be God’s provident and sovereign way of reordering or guiding a man’s steps in the right direction. The methods of God are past finding out, for no man can know what God does from the beginning to eternity. All that God gives us or makes us know about His plan for our lives are the ones we mature enough to comprehend.\nIsaac moved from highbrow quarters in Gerar to the Valley of Gerar to Rehoboth’s ample room. One would have thought it was a downward climb. Was sending Isaac out not a bad omen signalling tides were turning in the opposite of God’s promise to Abraham Isaac? Or how does one reconcile God’s “I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands” with the king’s “Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us”? The reality, however, remains that God was in a process and the expectation that His righteousness will not be cut short. As we would see, the intended destination was the Rehoboth area of Gerar, which was around the bushy places Abraham had marked with wells. But, God must have, in mercy, estimated the faith of Isaac and might have found it unable to take such giant strides.\nThe maps we read are scaled, wavy lines of massive landscapes. Yet, they help us navigate our ways successfully. The man who has heard instructions on what to do has only had a mind map of God’s intention for Him. The bigger picture would be more demanding. That is, the reality may demand many rerouting. But, of course, these maps or instructions from God will act as guideposts. Thus, when Bro Isaac Abraham was chased to Gerar’s Valley, the inner man’s eyes must have opened to the unexplored expanse of land in that region. Thus, he became freer to navigate. Our rerouting might be insight-, prayer- or persecution-driven. In Isaac’s case, it was resistance-based. Have you discovered your own?\nSince he had the freedom to explore now, his instinct first went intelligently to the wells his father dug to re-dig them. Oh, how this established that Isaac knew well the covenant of God with his father and the landmarks he made memorials for this sake! It gave God reassurance too that Isaac was committed to this generational covenant. Still, God permitted resistance, and Isaac greeted it with humility. However, God needed Isaac to dig his own wells. He needed him to make his own landmarks and increase the memorials that mark the lands that would be handed to his generations to come. God required him to add Esek and Sitnah to the places upon which the sole of Isaac’s feet shall tread.\nHave you the promise of God for your life and the confusion with which you battle to stamp your feet on the course set before you seem as dark as the dungeon Joseph found himself on His way to glory? Are there too many resistances on your route to Rehoboth? Has this confused you, and you are about to throw in the towel? I charge you to learn from this Patriarch that rerouting is one of the relaxation points on your road to Rehoboth. Have you been marched shamefully out of Gerar city with your activities in its Valley not spared by the opposition? Have you attempted to connect to those you think should disciple you in the faith, and satan-curated circumstances made them unreachable? God may have designed it that you should dig your own well. That is, seek Him as your present help in time of trouble and the most enjoyable company along the needy aisles of loneliness.\nMay God grant us the grace to be flexible enough to discern through circumstances that He speaks through every avenue.\nShalom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\nOdun Rotimi {OD}.

Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father. In concession, he sojourned at Gerah. Now Gerah was a place of many conflicts mixed with blessings. But Rehoboth was a blessed roomy place – a delight to one who has painfully sought rest from conflict attendant to obeying God.\nThe correlation between Abraham’s and Isaac’s sojourn holds for us a mine of truth, into which we may not explore in vain, should we endeavour to do so. Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.\nRestriction Genesis 26:2-5   “And the LORD appeared to him and said, ‘Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you. Live for a time in this land, and I will be… I will give… I will establish… I will multiply… Because Abraham obeyed Me and fulfilled his duty to Me, and kept My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”   It was an omnipotent God talking to a limited man. God could be anywhere at any time. But man can only be in one place at a time. So although God can be known uniquely in different locations globally, man is only well known if he can be associated with a particular place over a given period. Due to this, God has planned a place through substitution for Abraham. And every blessing that is associable with this covenant must be delivered within the confines of this location. Hence the restriction of Isaac’s protraction to Gerar.\nSecondly, the blessings Isaac was to enjoy were not due to his own qualification. It is God fulfilling the promised terms of His covenant with Abraham. It had nothing to do with Isaac’s current keeping of God’s commandments, statutes, and laws. Instead, it had everything to do but one with Abraham’s. Therefore, Isaac only needed to obey God and be at the location of the fulfilment of God’s promise to Abraham. We can thus conclude that Isaac had to adhere to being locationally restricted to enjoy the boundless covenanted blessings due to Abraham. He had to be localized in famine to access his planned plenty. He must be constrained to enjoy a copious shower. Even likewise, must you be rightly located to enjoy the everlasting covenant through the Blood of Jesus!\nNow God did not promise Abraham Egypt, Babylon, Ethiopia, Ephesus. He only said in verse 3, “…for to you and your descendants I will give all these lands.” This connoted Gerar was part of the land promised by God to Abraham, now being occupied by the Philistines and ruled by Abimelech.\nRemaining in our inheritance or, better still, possessing our possession in God entails that we are confined to the location marked out for us. The earth is of the Lord and the fullness thereof. But only by an allotment, its fullness can be ours. The Lord created vast earth but allotted Eden to Adam to tend. He had the world as a vast empire to Himself but only gave David Israel to rule. He has the whole world to Himself but restricted the ministry of Jesus to Palestine. My submission is that being restrained and choosing between alternatives is a critical junction where one decides to ply or continue plying the road to Rehoboth or not.\nLike his father, Abraham, Isaac might have decided for Egypt. The primary cause of famine in those days was drought. Digging wells lends evidence to this. And you don’t dig well wells in the rainy season but in the dry season. If there were rain, cisterns, no wells would have been drilled to hold water. However, Egypt did not need rain to survive. They had their profitable irrigation systems.\nMoreover, the Nile river gave Egypt sources for its thriving large-scale commercial agriculture. It was crucial to the economic survival of other parts of the world whenever famine struck. It was a flourishing land, a centre of attraction for any capitalist. Thence, it was a natural place to descend for a man with many slaves and livestock.\nOh, our Christian walk shall ever be a walk of choosing between unseemly Gerar and a lushly Egypt! It will ever be a walk of choice between being driven by faith or sight. What an attraction Egypt always is at first sight! It always attracts our first imagination. But would an interruption or interception confine us to stand with God’s choice? Permit me to also, remind you of the Lot’s attraction to the plains of the Jordan valley. Although, it was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord. But, it was not actually the garden of the Lord. Please note that resemblance is different from reality.\nImagine digging well in the face of legally backed hijacking in Gerar. In contrast, there are readily available rivers and lakes where Isaac would pay to water his livestock in Egypt. Imagine residence at the mercy of Abimelech when one can afford acres of land in Egypt and live without incursion. These and more are the contravening circumstances existent in the locations to which we are restricted and the alternatives to which we might have descended. Yet, the just shall continue living by continually believing.\nAs we would, nevertheless, see, the state of the land at any point, through the eyes of faith, does not in any way inhibit God’s intention to bless and make abundantly fruitful. As indicated by this story, a land fraught with drought might be a veritable “riverside” by which our souls are planted, such that it brings forth its fruits in our seasons. Conversely, a land filled with greenery and fruitful fields may be full of thorns and briers that chokes every spiritual vitality out of our souls. The decider lies in deciphering God’s will. Better to be restricted and blessed in the end than to be left to a fall-headed free-flow. Till we leave this earth, each disciple blessings and ministry are localized. To be out of space is to be out of coverage.\nShalom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\n","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2022-01-23-rehoboth-part-3/","title":"“…REHOBOTH…” (Part 3)"},{"categories":["Podcasts"],"contents":" How can a young woman make her way perfect?

Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.\nResistance Now that Isaac had repented and had begun to reap repleting returns, then suddenly surged the serpent’s head in furious envy. His blessings were bizarre to Abimelech. He could not factor out why a repentant lair should earn a plethora of God’s blessing. Here was he struggling to keep the economic landscape of Philistine in good shape in famine. Of course, attention was beginning to shift from the powers-that-be to this foreigner. The bush was burning with famine, but Isaac was unconsumed. Instead, his greenery lushes were impassable. “How is he doing it? How come?” must have been the questions on the lips of the citizenry. Isaac’s flourishing must have projected the Philistine government’s officials as clueless figureheads. They either need now bow to Isaac or seek consultative counsel from him. But to have this nomad rule over them, they will not concede. How can a wealthy man keep such a high moral standard of maintaining one wife? These and more are the questions Abimelech, and other Philistine rulers must answer if Isaac remained in Gerar.\nCan a man rejoice in tribulation? Be afflicted but not crushed; perplexed but not despairing; persecuted, and not abandoned; struck down but not destroyed, and not attract the attention of the fainting sinner in this fleeting world? If yes, the lot that befell Isaac cannot but be the experiences of everyone under the Abrahamic covenant. One may not understand the shame Isaac underwent until one imagines the city soldiers marching a man and his sizable fighting servants inherited from Abraham out of the town. It must have been a Gerar-wide event. I see the humility Isaac displayed by not lifting a finger to fight back. I perceive him matching on reasoning, “after all, I seek a city whose maker and builder is God. The Valley is a city if God decides to build it.” Who is the architect that will suddenly build a relief camp where they were headed, whose landscape they do not know! What a destabilizing resistance!\nFurthermore, his wells were blocked. What about the resources committed? What about the time wasted? What about the animals? How would they be watered? Isaac’s servants must have both old and young offspring; how would they survive the Valley of Gerar. The enemy does not mean it well for any Christian. Neither will his incarnates.\nFollowing the fall of man in the Garden of Eden, every stride of his for mere survival has been a struggle. We are always up against someone or something – tangible or intangible. To face the north is to back the south, whereas the ways of life in the north may be an utter alteration of the beliefs in the south. Motion and friction are elements of cause and effect. To avoid friction is to be steadily motionless. Thence, whatever stands one take in life, whatever truths one holds, whatever route one plies in life, there are bound to be opposition. Why? Truly Christians have been saved from the power and penalty of sin but not the presence of sin. The rule that governs the sin-cursed earth is “In sweat shall you eat.” We are not taken out of this world yet under Jesus’s instruction in His prayer in John 17. Thus, the lot that befalls all men in struggling for survival betides us too.\nAnyway, we are “spies‘ in this world, for our King who has gone on exile to receive a kingdom. The world is under the power of its possessor – the devil who is not the owner. Therefore, all Christians in the court of Satan are guilty of high-level treason. We are liable for a felony. But alas, he has power over everything but not the life of the “spies”. Every Christian is a threat to him and a reminder of his irreversible doom. Mr Christian, have you decided for Jesus? Satan does not mean it well for you. It is better to press for nearness to God as can be. Satan has no grace for forgiveness. He prides himself in being like God with his ability to take revenge. All the arsenals of the kingdom of hell are loosened against every disciple of Jesus. Whether he knows it or not. We have a saving grace. Given Satan is spoilt of option in the afflictions he can bedevil a Christian with. God does the final evaluation of the Christian’s strength and chooses the extent of the affliction’s reach.\nWe are not Holy Spirit-endued to wrestle against humans but are wrestling against filthy-spirit-possessed humans. Thence, the employment of non-carnal weapons of warfare.\nHowever, this resistance was not a waste. So many are the afflictions of the righteous the Bible iterates and illustrates, “but the Lord will deliver him from them all.” See the salvation of the Lord, were it not for this unprecedented hostility, Isaac might not have independently taken the initiative to depart Gerar. Oh, he had reached the heights of blessings and could not conceive that God had more in stock for him. He was a hundred-fold blessed man; he had transcended the heights of riches to that of wealthiness. Unknown to him, God intended his blessing to be a blessing a city built by him could contain. One may look gluttonous to be coveting such gifts. But since Isaac would not have envisaged this, God too was not under compulsion to tell him but used external resistance to reorder His steps.\nHow gracious is it to welcome resistance with God’s blessing! Didn’t Jesus promise us persecution disguised blessing for being sojourners that follow Him like Isaac? The blessings of the new testament pilgrim are in two: restoration of father, mother, land, family, and life in the Christian fold (deferred blessings); and persecution (disguised blessing). Persecution was expressed by Jesus as a blessing. Why?\nIn context, unprecedented expansion like growth in love, faith, and grace, cannot be comprehended by human understanding, which the Bible bid us not to rely upon. I wonder how the apostles in Jerusalem would have perceived the messenger that would have told them God would have them spread into the other parts of the world. When Peter was asked to absolve the centurion, he refused at first. They would not fathom it. In return, God raised Paul as a cruel vessel unto dishonour that dispersed these “Men of the Way,” bearing the invaluable seed of Christ-life in them. Thanks to that resistance by Paul, such that you and I can handle the precious word of life in the freedom that exists alone in God’s presence.\nMore so, resistance, that is, persecution is evidence of progress in an upward way. It is in a bit to scale upward heights that Satan’s dart, at you, will be hurled. If you press on, Satan will employ pressure. But be sure that the dividends that follow triumph through troubles, and the consolations from God with which we bring endurance to the fore, will bring a good sense of salvation, satisfaction and thanksgiving for the difficulties passed through to the promised land.\nShalom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\nOdun Rotimi {ODI}.\n","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2022-01-16-rehoboth-part-2/","title":"“…REHOBOTH…” (Part 2)"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"\u0026#8220;\u0026#8230;Rehoboth\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;  Key Text: Genesis 26:15-21\nThere are different stations in the walk of a man with His God.

Therefore, in this series, we shall consider the roughness and the smoothness of the route leading to the Rehoboth poses.\nReassurance The appearance of God to Isaac was not a sudden strike of the moon at noontide. God came with promises. According to Genesis 22, if well recalled, Isaac became God’s possession being offered as a relegated idol on Mt. Moriah. He cut a covenant with God as a living sacrifice – holy and acceptable to God. Thence, God’s appearance to Isaac in Philistine was devoid of that famous line, “Fear not.” Also, God’s appearance contrasted with Jacob was bereft of the ignorance displayed by Jacob. He said, “God was here, and I know it not.” He, in fact, did not know God. For if he knew Him, he would have anticipated Him on this journey, such that His appearance will not come as a rude shock.\nThat notwithstanding, based on the existing relationship between God and Isaac, God visited Him to reassure Him. What was the reassurance all about? Abraham had taught Isaac about God’s covenant with his lineage and how to obey the God of that covenant. The fulfilment was necessary to help this man in his pilgrimage. Therefore, God needed to speak to reassure him. No doubt, Isaac knew about his father’s ordeals. Abraham witnessed territorial famine, Isaac, too. So, he wouldn’t be wrong following his father’s footsteps to relocate. Friends, I hope the role model you are currently following is in intimate covenant with the Most High God? If not, stop and do a personal examination of that mentor or human handler (Discipler).\nHow God speaks once and makes us hear twice. Fast-forward to the challenges he faced seeking the fulfilment of God’s promise. I do not suppose that if he had not been ministered to with a second visit by God, he would easily have slipped to Egypt. How beautiful, for your journey, brother, that for a landmark pilgrimage in your life, you seek reassurance. Marriage is one of those lifelong sojourns; career is another.\nThere was an existing promise to Abraham, his father. Isaac had also had a personal encounter with God. But God knew his need and came to reassure Him that this generational promise would be fulfilled. Dear brother, you may not find God doubly advancing towards you for your journey. But has He not asked us to seek His face? Upon assurance, seek reassurance: it is not an act of doubt but of faith deepening. For not you, but the One who leads know what lies ahead. And He would be faithful to help.\nNote, however, the matters surrounding this reassurance. It had instructions: “Do not go down to Egypt… dwell in this land.” And Connected to it were promises: “…I will be with you and bless you… I will perform… I will make… I will give…” There is also a basis for reassurance – all the “I will’s” were “…because Abraham obeyed” His “voice and kept” His “charge, commandments, statutes and laws.”\nAre you seeking reassurance on a subject with God to no avail? Check how well you have kept your side of an erstwhile bargain of His. If you have messed it all up, kindly make it all up by repenting. And what do you think the next step to Rehoboth will be? Watch out!\nShallom.\nEvery Blessing in Christ.\nOdun Rotimi.\n","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2022-01-09-rehoboth-part-1/","title":"“…REHOBOTH…” (Part 1)"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"Marching on into the Year 2022  Texts: Numbers 21:1-9; Psalm 2:1-4.\nLife is a journey that is measured in time and season. And in the journey of life, there are contentions and challenges. Our pilgrims’ journey cannot be void of attacks, battles and rages from the enemy. If there is nothing good about your journey in life, the enemy will not trouble you. But because of the sacrificial death of Christ at Calvary, and because of the glorious inheritance that awaits you, then be ready for challenges and contentions from the kingdom of darkness.\nPersonally, I have discovered in the Bible that whenever God is on the move (when the children of the Lord are walking in obedience to the counsel of the Lord), the kingdom of darkness is always on the attack against the children of Light!\nIn this short passage, the Israelites marched towards the Promised Land. But in the usual manner, the enemy raised a hostile King Arad against them on the way. He fought against them and took away some of God’s children as captives. Is this not the way that Satan, sin, and self have taken captives of ignorant and innocent souls? Let me ask you, my dear friend, ‘Has Satan taken you captive in your thoughts and will? Are you currently a prisoner of your own conscience?\nFriends, the first thing I want to draw your attention to is this: ‘****Life is a battle, and we are called into a battle.’ A battle of sovereignty, ownership and providence. But the battle is not ours, but the Lord’s. Battles of life have levels and degrees; hence, you must choose your battle wisely and remember to hand it over to the Lord. Friends, have you handed over the battle of your ‘****self-life’ to the Lord at the Cross?\nSecondly, every battle begins in the heart. It is commonly said that the mind is the battlefield of all battles. And this is very true from a practical life experience. Therefore, it is expedient to charge you that you should diligently guard your hearts this year for therein lies the issues of life.\nThirdly, since the Lord is the mighty man in the midst of the battle, and that the battle is of the mind, then it is wise to hand over your mind to the Lord. He is the one who can contend with those who contend with you. Quick question, ‘What are you currently contending with, in your life?’ Sinful habits? Addictions? Mood-swing substances? Adultery? Lies? Gluttony? and so on and so forth.\nBeloved, we have come to a convenient day, a season of open heaven and enlargement breakthrough. The Year 2022 is a year of abiding, abounding and abundant fruitfulness. It is a year to continue to march on in our fruitfulness, despite the battles of uncertainties and insecurities that plagued the year 2021. We must, therefore, arise and keep marching on in righteousness, holiness, willingness and obedience.\nWe are now in the Day of His Power. Therefore, we must be filled with His fullness; be increasingly fruitful in manifesting His holy life to all; thereby bringing forth New Births to the Lord; with the determined purpose to raise them to become like Jesus through the process of concerted and cumulative discipleship!\nNECESSARY GUIDEPOSTS TO MARCH ON WITHIN THE NEW YEAR.\n  The first and foremost is to be born-again. So, my friend, before the Lord can fight for you, you must be on the Lord’s side. You must be a child of God. You must not be living in sin. The Holy Spirit must be living inside of you.\n  Following this, you must be in a personal discipleship relationship with a person approved by the Lord. The goal is to become like JESUS! Discipleship is the key to abundant Christian living here on earth.\n  You will also need the Fire of the Holy Spirit to keep you ablaze as an ignitable agent. Praying always without ceasing.\n  ‘Then the people of Israel made this vow to the Lord’: (Num. 21:2). This means that you must be in a progressive and cumulative functional intimate relationship with God. You must be a friend of God in prayer, communion, devotion and consecration.\n  Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life. Put away from you a deceitful mouth. And put perverse lips far from you. (Prov. 4:23-24).\n  Let your eyes look straight ahead. And your eyelids look right before you. Ponder the path of your feet. And let all your ways be established. (Prov. 4:25-26).\n  You must bear about in your body (mind) the death of Christ (which was for victory), so that the life of Christ may also be revealed in your body. (2Cor.4:10)\n  Daily live in humility and gentleness of Christ. Though you are in the world, ensure that you do not wage war as the world does. Always remember that your weapons of battle are not carnal, but mighty through God to pull down strongholds, casting down false arguments and every pretence that raises itself against the knowledge of God, and take captive ALL thoughts to the obedience of Christ. And be ready to punish all disobedience, once your own obedience is complete. (2Cor. 10:1, 3-6).\n  Looking unto the typified “bronze serpent” on the pole. This ‘’bronze serpent’ ‘on the pole is a symbol of the crucified Christ on the Cross at Calvary. For you to look at the ‘’bronze serpent” on the pole in the wilderness and be healed, takes faith and obedience. So, you must walk by faith and obedience to enjoy lasting victory in the Year 2022. You must keep looking unto Jesus (The Revelation of the Mystery of the Gospel) as a journey through the New Year 2022. (Num. 21:8-9; Heb. 12:2).\n  Let nothing separate you from the love of God. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. ** **For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom.8:37-39).\n  Give adequate attention to your personal spiritual training and development_. But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. (Jude 1:20-21)._\n  Remain strong and unstoppable in the Lord_. Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. (Eph. 6:10-11)._\n  In conclusion, you must not waste this day of His power in idleness and disobedience. No procrastination and presumption. You must keep marching on as holy militant soldiers of the Cross unto victory. You must be deliberate to take personal responsibility to sow and keep sowing until you experience a ‘Rehoboth’. Even after, you have experienced fruitfulness, you must never give up. “For the womb of a barren woman never stop crying for a child!” The Holy Spirit must impart upon you an unquenchable desperate hunger and thirst for His presence, wisdom, power, and soul-winning. An inner momentum for holy action.\nIt is my prayer that you will experience the great visitation like the day of the Pentecost in the book of Acts 2 where the Holy Spirit fell upon them all in the upper room like as a cloven tongue of fire. After which, the meeting place of their spirit-led prayer was filled with the Holy Spirit, and then they all went out to preach the Gospel with boldness. May the Lord work wonders in your life as you ‘go’ out and ‘sow’ in spirit, unto righteousness and in faith from church to church, house to house, city to city. May the Lord bring increase to His Word through your life and confirm it with signs, wonders and true repentance in Jesus name. Amen! Happy New Year 2022!

I bring this Christmas edition to you from the first book of the Bible, Genesis 26:22-25.\nThe events recorded in this chapter took place after Abraham’s death. It pointed to the fact that divine promises to Abraham have been passed unto Isaac. The season of famine was not strange to Isaac, for he had witnessed a similar situation in the days of his father Abraham, who went ‘down’ into Egypt without seeking God’s face. So, it was natural for him to decide to relocate to Egypt as well for survival. This seems to be the best choice at his disposal. My friend, what is your own best choice in your famine right now? Are you also thinking of going down to Egypt?\nInterestingly, on this occasion, after Isaac had discussed with King Abimelech, he too decided to go ‘down’ to Egypt. But, the Lord appeared to him, and said, ‘Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell thee of:’ Precious friend, who is your own ‘Abimelech’ that you are quietly having strange discussions with in order to validate your fast exit from that marriage, career, location, course etc?\nAs I looked into this narrative, I discovered that God is a ‘Covenant keeping God’. He alone has divine wisdom to determine your famine_,_ duration and expiration. The Lord’s covenant with Abraham was Canaan and not Egypt. Hence, God now instructed Isaac to remain in the Promised Land, and that He will bless him for doing so; ‘_I will establish the covenant that I swore to Abraham’_ (Gen.22:16-18), and the substance of this promise is reiterated in this narrative. And as I carefully follow this passage, I equally believe that your own abiding, abounding and abundant fruitfulness is premised on the promises, and visions of God for your life.\nBeloved, what I want you to know is that, not only was Isaac heir to the promises made by God, their fulfilment is intimately linked to him and his descendants. Do you know that through Christ Jesus, we also are Abraham’s offspring and joint-heirs to the same promise? Please take a brief moment and internalise this statement!\nSo, for this Abrahamic covenant to be ours, God sent forth His Son-Jesus, born of a woman through the Holy Spirit, but under the law, to redeem those who were under the bondage of the law and tyranny of sin, so that, we might receive adoption as sons (same and equal right as Isaac). And because we are sons, God’s Holy Spirit is saying to the believers, that ‘but now…’ sojourn in your own ‘Gerar’ no matter your famine! ‘Gerar’ here typifies your divine location or position. The famine is just for a while because a fruitful harvest is on the way. Do you know that the place of your exit is actually your place of bountiful harvest? So, remain there in obedience to the instructions of the Lord. Bear in mind that, it is obedience that the Lord is testing here.\nBeloved, as I noted in Gen 26:22, there is a “but now…” in the move of God this season for you and your family. So, contrary to all expectations and facts before you, I am glad to announce to you that the Lord has decided to make large rooms for you. For this reason, let it settle in your mind that, regardless of the contentions, hostilities, delays, rejections, God is not powerless. ‘But now…’ contrary to all odds against you, God has decided to still make large rooms for you. Amen!\n‘But now…’ means that you have to put all that behind you. They have become ashes. Do not dwell on ashes. They are extinguishers of God’s promises for your life. They are also not pleasant to the eyes. You must, therefore, pack them out of sight and out of mind.\nFriend,\nI want you to know that it is not that God was less powerful to intervene and stop you from your contention with self-life but now…\nIt is not that God was blind and deaf to all the insult and assault at you but now…\nIt is not actually about your skill and ability, it is just that God’s time to step into your situation has not yet reached the peak but now…\nIt is not that God just closed His eyes to the sins, and wickedness in the world but now…\nIt is not that God could not deal with the sinful nature, and the corruption in the society, but now…\nIt is not that God was weak or slack in His promises to save and bless, it is only that He is patient awaiting men to turn away from dead works and have faith towards Him, but now…\nIt is not that God cannot deal with those distorting the truth, creating psychological fear and warmongering in the world, but now…\nIt is not that God had been removed from His throne or that the increase of His government is no more on Jesus’s shoulders, but now…\nIt is not that God is not aware of the LGBTQ+ mobilisation, climate change issues, He is only been patient to save many who are profaned in mind, but now…\nIt is not that God cannot stop human trafficking, child abuse, sex exploitation but now…\nIt is not that God cannot stop the Islamic extremists in Nigeria, the Middle East, Europe, but since He has put His Church in charge, but now…\nIt is not that God is unaware of the divisions, decay and deplorable conditions of the Church of Christ, even though Christ is still the head, but now…\nIt is not that God is panicking over the solution to the Covid-19 Global Health crisis and the peddling culture by the pharmaceutical Industries, but now…\nIt is not that God is unmindful of millions of lost souls, Fulani herdsmen senseless killings and kidnappings, and corruption in Nigeria, but now… God has decided to arise and remind the Adamic race of His divine sovereignty, ownership, and providence to all, in spite of all the wickedness in the world.\n“But Now…” means enough is enough, I have put all these behind me, I have seen that human thoughts are constantly evil. I have decided not to contend with man. It is high time I started raising a fresh crop of New Creation men/women as agents of transformation through the instrument of DISCIPLESHIP to occupy (sow in righteousness, faith, prayer, time, active goodness etc) till I come.\nFriends, I pray the Lord will open your spiritual eyes to see what He is saying to you. As for me, I see God making room for us in the House of assemblies, House of parliament, Palaces, cabinet offices, the legislative, the judiciary, the executive, education and academic research, sports, culture, music, to re-crop new species of men as agents of revival in the nations for the glorious appearance of His Son-Jesus Christ.\nWe have come to the days of His power. It is the season of the birth of the Prophetic and Apostolic movements. It has both divine direction and divine strategy. This move is unstoppable, undeniable, and of surpassing scope and dimension. It must not be a monument. It is a dynamic movement. We must not form personality cults, not build an empire, not be religious, no overemphasis and denominational dogmas. It must not be eroded and damned. It is to dig, dig, dig, deep into the hearts of men the Gospel of Christ until their hearts touches the springs of living water, be filled, and in turn pour into others. It is not about ‘my’, ‘our’ denomination. It must not be localized, marginalised and contaminated. It is a Revival! It must flow to all nations. God himself will supervise and administer it by His Holy Spirit into all nations. This is the season of establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth! For Heaven has made room for us. Contrary to all expectations, we now have the divine opportunity to be fruitful even in times like this…\nTherefore, we must arise and take responsibility for this commission and by God’s grace we shall! Strangely this Rehoboth is never negative nor positive. It is the reason for the season. It is to multiply disciples in the nations, to populate the kingdom of God and depopulate hell. It is a season to multiply abundantly, for God has made room for us. So, if you are willing and obedient I say, ” fear not…“; for the Lord is with you, He will bless and multiply your obedience abundantly, aboundingly and abidingly for Jesus’s sake. Arise today, go up to your own Beersheba, and make a covenant with God as a living sacrifice.\nSo, just as Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year hundred-fold, God is ready to bless you too, if you are willing and obedient to sow in His chosen place for you. Dare to dwell in the promised land, sow in righteousness and to the Spirit? Then be ready to experience multiplication, fruitfulness, and enlargement.\nFinally, it is instructive to remind you that, though God has made the room for us in this famine, it is not the season to quarrel, seek revenge, engage jealousy and envy, but to legislate Christ light-life, multiply disciples and to prepare men for Heaven.\nWhat to do\n Arise and take up responsibility for this commission this Christmas season. Come to God in sincere repentance from your sins and have faith towards Him. Do not fear, make a Holy Covenant with God as a living sacrifice; Enlarge the place of your tent, clear lots of ground for your tents!\nMake your tents large. Spread out! Think big!\nUse plenty of rope,\ndrive the tent pegs deep.\nYou’re going to need lots of elbow room\nfor your growing family.\nYou’re going to take over whole nations;\nyou’re going to resettle abandoned cities.\nDon’t be afraid—you’re not going to be embarrassed.\nDon’t hold back—you’re not going to come up short.\nYou’ll forget all about the humiliations of your youth,\nand the indignities of being a widow will fade from memory.\nFor your Maker is your bridegroom,\nhis name, God-of-the-Angel-Armies!\nYour Redeemer is The Holy of Israel,\nknown as God of the whole earth.\nYou were like an abandoned wife, devastated with grief,\nand God welcomed you back,\nLike a woman married young\nand then left,” says your God. (Isaiah 54:2-6)  Repent, and return to the Lord if you are currently on your way down to Egypt.\nGod has now made large room for us.\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year****!\nGBENGA AKINDELE.\n ","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2021-12-24-letter-to-young-mr-youth-3-youth-series/","title":"2021 Christmas Message to Our Readers- “But now…”"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"1.1 The Valley of Dry Bones 🦴🦴 We have never heard of the mountain of dry bones but we have read of the valley of dry bones.

But according to the Bible, God says, ‘My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. As good as self-discipline and rules in dealing with a problem are, they are only human efforts in dealing with the Old Man. Mankind will only continue striving and struggling with Mr. flesh by following strict rules and regulations. This is what the Bible calls self-righteousness.\nHowever, if we exercise our faith and not our sight or strength, we are certain to have a personal revelation of the transaction that took place on the Cross. And the only way you can experience this is simply by “KNOWING THIS…” You don’t have to memorise, prophecy or speak in tongues**.** All you need to know is this truth, not many truths. Just this one thing, that the principle of life is DEATH. And this DEATH happened on the Cross at Calvary, where “**_Your Old Man and mine was crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth, we no longer serve sin”_**.\n Death is the principle of life. Rom. 7:1-4, Rom. 6:5, 7-8, Rom. 8: 32 KJV. For as long as a man lives, the law has dominion over the man. Just as a woman who has a husband is bound to him, so likewise we were bound to the Old Man. But when the right time came, God sent His Only Begotten Son – JESUS CHRIST, to deliver or separate us from the bondage of our ex-husband – Mr Flesh. But thanks be to God who did not spare his own Son, but delivered Him for us all as the perfect sacrifice on the Cross at Calvary! And by GOD’s divine working and timing, JESUS CHRIST paid the full price (DEATH) from the bondage of sin, self, the world system and satan. Your very SELF and my SELF was crucified with Him on the Cross. So, by faith in this truth, it is no longer I who lives, but Christ, who now lives in you and me, Hallelujah! (Rom. 6:6, Isa. 53:4-6, Heb. 2:9, 14-15, Gal. 2:20-21 KJV). You are now DEAD! (2Cor. 5:14, Col. 3:3, Gal. 2:20 KJV).  But I can hear you say, ‘But how? I am still alive?’ Yes, you are, but no longer of your old SELF, but the NEW CREATION MAN! (2Cor. 5:17; 1Cor. 6:19-20). N.B: the body (container) is still the same. Nevertheless, there is a New Creation Man – the Light-life of GOD in you right now. It takes faith and not sight to believe. This must be a daily revelation to you. You must keep substantiating – KNOWING THIS! This New Creation Man is JESUS CHRIST. You must believe that you are DEAD. Because he that is dead is freed from sin. The life of sin was destroyed on the Cross. The very stronghold of sin has been broken and dismantled in your life. The flesh cannot be your master and ruler again. This truth has empowered you to say ‘NO’ to Mr Flesh and ‘YES’ to CHRIST.\nThe resurrected LORD has bought you; your body now belongs to Him; so that He can dwell in you and walk in you in this world. (2 Cor. 6:19-20). He is the Light-life in you. You must understand this. It can only come by a personal revelation from God that your Old life is terminated. It passed away on the day you met CHRIST, accepted Him as your personal LORD and Saviour. That day you received the HOLY SPIRIT and became born again. A New Creature in CHRIST JESUS (Eph.1: 11, 14 GNB). Amen.\n**QUESTION: What then should be your response to this divine truth? **\n{2Cor. 5:15, Gal. 2:20, Rom. 6:1,2,11,13; Col. 3:5, 12-17; Rom. 12:1-2}.\nAt this point in this segment, it must be clear to you why JESUS died for mankind on the Cross. And also, why He drank the Mysterious Cup presented to Him in the Garden of Gethsemane. The purpose for these things is that, you no longer live for and unto your SELF – the Old Man inside you; but for and unto JESUS. \nThe next critical point is that you must refuse to bear fruit for Mr Flesh. This is because you are no more under his tyranny and bondage again. He is dead and buried away for life. You have been delivered once and for all from his slavery. This, you must keep knowing daily. Have you seen a drunken man certified dead by a pathologist still drinking? The answer is ‘NO!’ All the old things like drunkenness, cursing, silly talks perished with him in the grave. So, likewise, self and satan can no longer influence your life with sins. For you are DEAD, and your new life is hidden with Christ in God. For example, if a serpent swallows a lizard and the serpent is killed, what do you think happened to the lizard? The lizard also dies.\n“So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ…” (Rom. 7:4a). NIV.\nThe next instructive matter is to bear fruit meet for the New Creation Man. He is now at work in you, both to will and to do, of His own good purpose. (Phil. 2:13)\nYour new ‘husband’ is now JESUS CHRIST. You must now live as He tells you to do. It is Him alone you must obey because you are now under new management. So, if you are certain that you died with CHRIST; certain that you were buried with CHRIST; certain that you have now risen with CHRIST; then you MUST now spontaneously seek those things which are above. You must now bear fruits meet for repentance – Fruits of the Spirit.\nIn terms of your affections, desires, tastes and appetites; you must deliberately now set them not on the things on the earth, but heavenly things. You must consciously fill and occupy your thoughts with things that are lovely; pure; true; praiseworthy; good virtue and just. You must take effort to exercise your faith in this Mystery of CHRIST death on the Cross by REPLACING dirty, evil, lustful and impure thoughts and desires WITH pure, good and just thoughts and desires. If you fail to actively say NO! to the devil and his temptations, he will come back strongly and multiply his demons in your desires. And your case will be more terrible than before.\nN.B: Nature abhors a state of vacuum. We are not an angel. We are containers that must be filled. But be diligent to take guard of what goes in and comes out of your heart.\nFinally, therefore, you must put off the Old Man and his works – fornication, adultery, covetousness, inordinate affection, lying etc. But don’t stop here. In exchange, put on the New Man and his fruit of the spirit-love, faith, patience, kindness, gentleness, joy, meekness etc. Gal.5:22-23. Remember that your location, nature, and perspective have now changed from earthly issues to heavenly issues.\nDAILY APPLICATION OF THE NEW CREATION MAN LIFE\nPlease let me remind you that as touching the divine exchange, the content new nature and thoughts, one thing remains constant -the physical body. Even though your friends and family may not understand your new faith, you must **keep knowing **that there is a GREAT change. Each time they ask you to show them proof that you are truly dead, you don’t need to. All you say to them is, “I am sorry, the Old Man – your former acquaintance is dead; he passed away. The life in me is the New Creation Man Life – the resurrected LORD from heaven now dwells in me.” You must learn this song in order to assist in your response to all their quest to/for their dead kinsman:\nIT IS NO LONGER I THAT LIVETH \nIt is no longer I that liveth (readeth, preacheth, teacheth, singeth).\n_ But CHRIST that liveth in me (2ce)_\n_ He lives in me (2ce)_\n_ JESUS is the life in me_\n_ It is no longer I that liveth_\n_ But CHRIST that liveth in me._\nYour deliverance is not through human ability or skills but through faith in the living word of God. As Romans 6:11 KJV says, “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord”.\nThe word ‘reckon’ is an accounting terminology that means to count it, consider it. Inferring that when Christ died, you were inside of Him and that you too died with Him when your Old Man was crucified with Christ on the Cross.\nInterestingly, the accounting profession is one of the professions that is based on historical records and facts. And since, the Cross is not a myth to you anymore but a fact, you too must equally deem it as factual, true and evidential. So, whether you believe it or not, Calvary has happened. CHRIST died on the Cross. Nothing can change it. No one can undo it. Not even satan! You must reckon it as true. And you are to live your life on this premise. And when He arose, we likewise were quickened by His resurrection power and life. Praise the Lord!\nHaving received the GRACE of God to be saved through faith in Christ death, you must now daily yield your members as instruments of righteousness. CHRIST is now the OWNER and OCCUPIER. He is not a tenant. He is the LORD. HE is the Husband and the Head. He did not borrow you, He bought you at a price FULLY PAID! He chose you by himself. You did not choose Him. So, start living daily in the FULLNESS of this gracious work and divine revelation of the death of CHRIST on the CROSS daily in JESUS name. Amen.\n** **PERSONAL EVALUATION\n Please tell us what are the (old fixtures and fittings) dead works of Mr. flesh that you have identified and packed out of your own life? Someone once said that “it is only a fool who holds unto what he cannot keep, and do not keep what he can lose”. In the light of this statement, please share with others the former things you still love to keep and why? Do you think it is an offence to the world when we daily carry our Cross, to follow CHRIST? With a practical life experience, kindly share with others the principle of, “putting off the old life and putting on the new life”?

ARISE. GO FORTH. SPEAK.\nArise to the fact that Absalom (your Old Man) is dead and buried! It means to wake up to the reality of victorious Christian living. Get out of your life of defeat of sin and bondage of satan because you have dwelt too long on the alley of darkness and valley of the shadow of death. So, jump out into the marvellous light of the Kingdom of God in the light. (Col.1:12-13). Stop struggling with it, simply trust in Jesus by handing over your life to Him. The Holy Spirit is saying, ‘can’t you see gross darkness covering the earth and the people? Don’t keep the Master waiting for His glory shall rise upon thee as you respond in obedience. You were born to shine the life light so that, sin (many sinful Absalom) will not multiply in the land any longer. But, if your David fails to arise, shine, then the temple will remain empty, and darkness will prevail over it. Dare to be a David, dare to be a Daniel? Then, it is time to Arise, shine for your Absalom is dead and your King David (Christ) must return to the throne! Why do you still doubt the scriptures? He (your old man) died on the cross to live no more. Stop sitting down (living) as though he is still alive. Accept it. It is a settled matter. Arise to this truth and stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free. Amen!\n** **** **Go forth\nBut before you can go forth, you must first come out of every confinement/room that Satan has subtly to keep you in. Come out of every sinful habit and carnal pleasure. Out of every sinful addiction and corruption. Out of ungodly marriage and relationships that the Old Man has left you bound. Out of failure and defeat, you have suffered for long in the hands of the taskmaster. Come out of that deception and blame. The man Absalom before he died, deceived the father, the brothers, Joab, two hundred men who followed him not knowing his evil intentions. In case you are in a bad company or organization whereby your conscience is pricking you daily, you need to heed this warning before it is too late for you. For all you care, you might be serving an Absalom-who is an enemy of God and the Kingdom of God. Just like the Old Man, Absalom was an enemy of joy, peace, and righteousness of the Holy Spirit. Absalom was an agent of confusion and shame. He was a terror to Israel waiting to destroy the purpose of God.\nTherefore, God is calling on you to Go forth in victory and dominion. Go forth in His name and by His Word. You can only do so by deliberately looking at the Cross. And it takes faith to look at the Cross. But note that in your going forth, it must be by denying yourself and daily carrying your cross and following Jesus. (Lk.9:23) You will need to always place the Cross before you because the enemy you are dealing with is clever and wicked. So, you must steadfastly cling to the Cross i.e., you must go forth in the power of the Gospel of Christ. Putting on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. You must also Go forth with the testimony of Christ, which is the spirit of Prophecy. Remember that in going forth, you will also require as a matter of necessity the following: Belt of truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, having your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace, putting on the shield of faith, whereby you shall quench the fiery darts of the wicked one.\nIn addition, you need to be fortified with the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and finally, the power of prayer and supplication in the Spirit, watching with patience and perseverance as you Go forth.\n** **Speak this truth.\nIt is what a man knows that he will speak. So, you must keep knowing this…that our Old Man has been crucified with Christ on the Cross… Don’t allow the enemy to shut your mouth. Speak it. Affirm it. Stand on it. Re-affirm it in the face of every lie and trick of the enemy. Don’t be silent. Speak it. Learn the truth, Love the Truth, Live the truth. The scripture says;\n ‘****that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation. (Rom.10:9-10)\nIf you don’t do this, the danger is that the latter end may be worse than the beginning. In this passage (vs7b), Joab was warning David about a serious matter. Equally, that was what Christ was also noting in Lk 11:24-26. On the one hand, the old man is dead and evacuated. However, a vacuum is now left that needs to be filled by the King of Kings. Failure to fill this vacuum risks him who has gone to return with far stronger adversaries more wicked than the earlier; the latter end is worse than the beginning.\nAs such, having heard of the death of the Absalom, there is a need to accept it as the death of the Old Man; Joab’s charge was, ‘then arise, go forth and speak this truth’.\nBy the way, what is this truth that you must speak? The truth we are talking about is not relative but the absolute truth. The truth that Jesus came in the flesh, Jesus died on the Cross, Jesus was buried and rose from the dead on the third day. The truth is reality. It is that Jesus is the resurrection and life. He has risen from the dead. He is no more in the grave. He is now seated upon the throne at the right hand of the Father almighty on High and that He is coming soon! This is the Good News that we must herald to the whole world that Jesus Christ is risen and He is on the throne. Proclaim it on the hill, in the valley, in the park, on the train, on land, on the sea, in the air, in the marketplace, workplaces, and everywhere. Instead of spending your precious time on the internet, the news, argument, discussion, politics, fashion, on sports and movies, let us all arise and proclaim everywhere the Truth and the second coming of the King of kings and the Lord of Lords.\nEnough with blaming each other in the churches, enough with spreading innuendos and malicious statements about others in the Body of Christ. It is high time we ceased such corrupt practices and arise, go forth and speak of the Good News. The Good News of our salvation from sin, self, Satan, and the world system. Now our Absalom (Old Man) is dead. Let us all arise, go forth, and bring back the King Jesus again to reign and rule in our hearts forever, on the pulpit, on the pews. Enough of procrastination, unbelief, negativity, jealousy, and fear. Let’s arise and talk about Jesus. Let’s make Him famous on every platform, nation, and continent. This is our collective responsibility. From the priests, to the prophets; from the evangelist to the teachers and pastors; from the deacons to the elders in the churches; from the apex leaders to the gatekeepers, let us all arise and go forth in this day of his power. There is a revival going on out there. Heaven is ready, but are you ready? Why are you still holding out? Yet you are my brothers and sisters in Christ, my brethren saved by grace through faith in the blood of the Lamb! The Prophet Isaiah 52:7 says; ‘How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!’\nFinally, never forget the ENTHRONING of the King of Kings back into His rightful place in the centre of your heart. Ask the Holy Spirit to come into your life to reign and rule as the sovereign Lord. Let Christ take His place and give Him first place in your life, marriage, business, work, ministry, home, education, and devotion. Invite Him into everything you do and into all your decisions.\nConfess your sins, repent and acknowledge Him as the king. Consult Him. Give Him the reins of your heart and let Him lead you. Let Him come and live His victorious life in you. Carry Him everywhere you go, saying that … ‘Absalom is dead. Enthrone the King of Kings’.\nIt is our prayer that as you come into contact with this article, that you will encounter the risen Christ personally. May the Spirit of God illuminate your eyes in the inner man to behold with an increasing degree the profound imageries of Calvary and the Man of Calvary who gave His life as a ransom for you. So, that the way you leave hereafter will honour and please the Lord, and your life will produce every kind of good fruit. Then, you will grow as you learn to know God better and better in your personal walk with Him in Jesus name. Shalom!\nGrace be multiplied unto you.\nYour friends Taiwo and Gbenga.\n","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2021-05-02-absalom-is-dead-final-part/","title":"Absalom is Dead  (Final Part)"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"Absalom is dead (Part 3)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) The case of Absalom.\nBeloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**– (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom. The is the first response that God demands from you. For you cannot follow Christ with such corrupt life. It is an impossible road to heaven. It cannot please God.\nAbsalom is dead. Absalom, representing the old man (Mr. Flesh). He is in conflict with David (King Jesus), and seeks to displace and dethrone Him is dead! His death certificate was signed, sealed, and delivered on the Cross of Calvary. Hallelujah!\nHowever, like David, because of my affection/lust/affinity/attachment with this old man, there is a struggle to accept the fact of his death. There is a struggle to accept the unchanging and irreversible truth that he died with Christ on the Cross. (Rom.6.6; Gal.2:20 KJV).\nDavid was struggling to accept that Absalom was dead but Absalom was not struggling because he was dead and gone. Do you know that in practical terms, this is the bane of our struggle with God? It was the same struggle that Jacob lived with for 21 years before he had an encounter at the brook Jabbok. So, when Jacob could no longer continue with this long struggle, he held on to the man, but when the man saw that he would let him go, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of his thigh was out of joint, as Jacob wrestled with the man. David was struggling to come to terms with this.\nSo, my friend is this your situation? then, why don’t you too surrender? why don’t you yield your life and be still before the Lord to transform your corrupt lifestyle? Jesus is waiting for you. Don’t leave for too long. It might be too late.\nGoing on, though the death of our old man is an established and unchanging fact as revealed in the Word of God (Rom.6:6 KJV), a majority still struggle many times to accept this reality. They still live as if the Cross has not happened. They still cry over spilled milk. They still desire the garlic, cucumber of Egypt though they have physically left their Egypt. But spiritually in their mind, they have not reckoned (accounted) their Old Man (Absalom) as indeed dead.\nBeloved, do you know that you are in Christ, Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new! And as such, you must reckon yourself alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord. In the case of David, he wrestled to accept the death of Absalom. Hence, he could not reckon it as great a victory what God did through the Armies of Israel in putting to death his enemy Absalom at the battle of Ephraim forest.\nFurthermore, let us attempt to note few similarities between the death of Absalom and our Old Man: both have an eye for the throne, both were full of intrigues and smart schemes, both were proud and unruly. Both were disobedient, revengeful, and stubborn in all their ways. Both sought external glory instead of the inner beauty of peace and righteousness. Both loved to be worshipped and served. Both became fugitives and led the rebellion against their Master and Lord. Both were banished from the palace and the Kingdom. Both died hanging on a tree with their heads crushed!\nJust like King David in this narrative, oftentimes we struggle to accept the death of our old nature which Christ put to death on the cross. The dangers of this struggle are these:\n The people, instead of rejoicing and living in the victory that was obtained that day, were in mourning. The victory that day was turned into mourning and the people were moving around as though they were defeated in battle. ‘As the people heard of the king’s deep grief for his son, the joy of that day’s wonderful victory was turned into deep sadness. The entire army crept back into the city as though they were ashamed and had been beaten in battle’. (2Sam.19:2-3 TLB). I will have you know that this is one of the clever schemes of the devil to make a mockery of the Power of the Cross! You must not fall for this scheme. It is the lie of the devil.  Therefore, let it be known that the devil is a defeated foe. He lost the battle at Calvary when Jesus said, ‘It is finished. At this point, it is instructive for you to know that your failure to accept the death of the Old Man will make the enemy keep you in perpetual defeat.\nAs such, instead of living continuously in the victory that Christ purchased for you on the Cross, there is this inner struggle with sin, recurring defeat, and frustration. Consequently, it seems as though the Christian life cannot be lived in continuous, perpetual victory. This is a lie of the enemy and stems from the struggle to accept the settled death of the Old Man. But thanks be to God that on the Cross at Calvary our Old Man was crucified with Christ. (Romans 6:6-7 KJV) says, ‘Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin’.\n Another danger is that, like David, our struggle to accept this death of the old man is likened to showing ingratitude to Him who went to the Cross on our behalf. This was what Joab was telling David (2Sam.19:5-6 KJV). And there is a big lesson here for you and me because it took Joab, David’s commander in chief to jolt David to his senses as it were.  Looking through these two verses, it is as if Joab was reminding David that, ‘You seem not to place value on the victory over Absalom death. We have saved your own life and that of your household by risking our own lives; and yet you act foolishly, making us feel stupid and ashamed for killing Absalom. And it is as if we have committed an abomination! You seem to love your evil-laden rebellious son than us who love you. But the way I see it, all our effort in risking our own dear lives is of no significant value to you. I am sure if Absalom had lived and we all died, would have pleased you right?’\nThe life application to this is that just like David slighted the victory on that day, even likewise, there are many so-called believers today who are slighting or reducing the priceless value of the finished work of Christ on the Cross. They are rejecting the Only Begotten-Son of God who gave His own precious life as a ransom to redeem mankind from the tyranny and bondage of sin and satan. They are turning their backs on the perfect substitute who took their place on the Cross through their unbelief.\nFriend, are you also ungrateful like David? Would you rather prefer that you continue your old relationship with sin to Jesus? Do you also love your sinful friend more than Jesus? Does Jesus’ sacrifice count more than the pleasures of sin? David was blinded by his love for his rebellious son, are you equally blindfolded by the god of this world such that you continuously fail to see the light of His glory shine in your hearts? To me, this ingratitude is shameful and troubling. What about you? please refrain from your ingratitude and unbelief. According to (Hebrew 3:13-19 NLT), many perished in the wilderness because of these things.\n The other danger to this truth is the faulty perspective that the Cross is past and historical. And therefore, it is just a mere symbol or religious woodwork. This to me is a dangerous supposition. And it can be costly. No wonder the Church of today is weak and impotent in extending the gains of the Cross in its ministry. It is sad to see many churchgoers ignorant of the real meaning of the Cross and its effectiveness. (2Cor.4:3-4 KJV). Others even deny its power. And from such people the Bible says you should avoid.  But I will have you know that the power of the wondrous cross is real, active, living, and powerful to save the sinner and to deliver you from any demonic attack or household wickedness. This scripture says that;\n‘For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.\n _For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. (1 Cor._1:17-18 KJV) also read (Rom.1:16-17 KJV). But you must note that the Cross is only a real-time to the man who continually looks at it in faith. Do not be fickle-minded about the finished work of the Cross. The Cross is the saving and keeping power for daily living. The next danger is the substitution of the Cross for beggarly means. You must not fall for the subtle deception of the devil in rendering the Cross as being void and mere symbol. (Isa. 5:13-14 KJV). It is not so. The Cross is God’s comprehensive instrument for dealing with the Old Man. Our old man was crucified on the Cross at Calvary. Never believe the lie of the devil and do not compromise your faith. (Gal. 3:22-25 KJV). No sophistication or westernization can substitute for the power of the Cross. Not even technology can rival the efficacy of the Cross. Please note that even Jesus’ climax of ministry and obedience were both at the Cross. Whether it is an argument, sickness, quarrel, disobedience, corruption, poverty, tradition, etc, they all terminate at the Cross.

And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom. May the Lord illuminate your heart.\nHuman nature is generally referred to in some Bible versions as the Old Man or the Flesh. It is the art of being human in character, conduct, and conversation. We all inherited human nature by birth. Everyone born of woman, no matter your race, education, colour, gender, status, and position, is born with the natural traits of the human fallen nature. This human nature is the worthless manner of life that we received from our ancestors. It is an impossible road to heaven. This is the kind of life that Absalom exhibited in this narrative as we shall soon discover for our learning and correction. This kind of life cannot be changed by fasting, giving an offering, tithes, prayer, good works, singing, or church attendance. For the scripture says, ‘that which is born of the flesh is flesh…’ and they that are of the flesh cannot please God at all.\nWhat are the activities of the Old Man?\nLet us closely look at Galatians 5:19-21;\nNow the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal.5:19-21). KJV.\nWhat human nature does is quite plain. It shows itself in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions; in the worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups; they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before: those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God. (GNT)\nWhat the Old Man does is quite plain. The Old Man loves to show itself anywhere, anytime, and in anybody. It can show itself in the church, in fellowship, at home, in the workplace. You will shortly see a catalogue of these dead works being exhibited by Absalom. You must note also that the Flesh does not only show itself in abominable acts but also seemingly good things.\nAccording to the scripture, I discovered that the old man has many aliases. He is also called the Natural man, the Carnal man, the Human Nature, Mr. Flesh. Mr. Iniquity, Selfish Man, Fallen Man, Corrupt/Sinful Nature. The Old Man is unruly, incorrigible, rebellious, and disobedient. He is envious by nature. He loves to cover up. He cannot stand the presence of God and the life light. He easily passes blame. He gives excuses. He is given to lies. He loves to be popular, worshipped, and celebrated. He seeks after external beauty and not inward beauty of meekness and quiet spirit. He is vengeful and wicked. Pride is innate to the Old Man. He is ungrateful, unpleasing, impatient, and inconsiderate. He is lawless and godless. He loves anything that is darkness. He is always envious, argumentative, defensive, and unapologetic. Hates to be corrected. Hates embarrassment and disgrace. He loves to cover up. Old Man always wants to have his own way and own rule. He makes you be ashamed when you meet your mates without being ready. He is unforgiving. He loves acceptance, acquisition, achievement. Always find fault in practically everything. This is the life we inherited from the fallen Adam and Eve after they were banished from the presence of the Lord.\nGOD’S Judgment on the Old Man and the Instrument. (Job 14:14; 1John 3:8; Rev, 21:8; Rom.6:6; Gal.2:20)\nThe verdict of God on the Old Man is death. For he is corrupt all the way. He cannot be pampered, cajoled, or nursed. He is older than you and me. You can neither improve on him nor nourish him with the hope that it will change and please God. And don’t attempt to cherish the Old Man. The answer to the alluring potent power of sinful nature is no, no, a million times. Whenever you find a sinning man or woman, it simply shows that they are under the domination and control of the Old Man. This Old Man has been sinning from the beginning. Sin is not your friend. Sin is your enemy.\nSo, if you have been genuinely born into the holy family of God, you have the Heavenly DNA in you. Hence, you don’t make sin a lifestyle again. The reason is that the lawless intrinsic character of the devil is no more in you. There are two natures, sinful nature (from the Old Man) and godly nature (from God upon being born again of the Spirit). To live by the Spirit is to be controlled and governed by God’s Will in purpose, action, and thought. And to live by the flesh is to be controlled and ruled over by your own selfish will, impulse, emotions, and carnal cravings.\nTherefore, the reason why Jesus was made manifest was to destroy the works that the devil has done in our lives through the Old Man. And God’s only divine provision for dealing with the Flesh is the Cross. Hence, the only way to terminate the unruly, rebellious, arrogant, and deceptive nature of Absalom is the Cross. For without this David, his men, and the people of Israel cannot have lasting peace, progress, and prosperity.\nSubsequently, it is imperative that you MUST as a necessity keep “knowing this… that (your) the Old Man has been crucified with Christ on the Cross…”\n ","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2021-05-02-absalom-is-dead-2/","title":"Absalom is Dead  2"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"Absalom is dead  Texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12. Let me begin by pointing your attention to the name ‘Absalom’. It is interesting to note here that the name Absalom means, ‘The father of Peace’. But sadly, you will discover that his lifestyle was a complete contrast to the true meaning of his name. Then what bothers me is the fact that how can the ‘father of peace’ suddenly become the ‘father of intrigues and evil schemes?\nAbsalom was the third son of David, the king of Israel. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (2Sam.3:3; 14:25). He was therefore a prince from both parent’s lineage. He was the most handsome man in the kingdom at that time. But because of his unruly and disobedient lifestyle, he was killed in the Battle of Ephraim Woods.\nAs I write this article, I discovered that both Absalom’s description and rebellious lifestyles remind me of exactly that of Lucifer, who later became the Devil. The Bible initially described him as ‘… O Lucifer, son of the morning! How thou cut down to the ground, which didst weakens the nations! For thou, hast said in thine heart, “I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.” (Isaiah 14:12-14).\nFrom the quoted scripture above, I noted the root of Lucifer’s sudden fall from the presence of the Most High God to the depths of the pit. The Bible says, ‘for thou hast said in thine heart…’. Furthermore, as I carefully searched the scripture, I discovered that the root of both Absalom and Lucifer’s fall from grace to grass was the sin of ‘PRIDE’. No wonder the Proverbs said, ‘Pride goes before destruction; and a haughty spirit before a fall.’ and ‘For as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he:’ Friend, I just wonder what is the condition of your heart as you read this article? Is it pure or impure? Evil or godly? Carnal or eternal?\nSecondly, I also noted that both of them had personal attractiveness, they were unruly and both ended their positions under tragic circumstances that were worse than death. And not only that, both in their rebellion drew along with them innocent beings unto eternal doom and death (they both led a rebellion against their head. Lucifer led a rebellion against the Lord. While Absalom led a rebellion against David, the father, and King of Israel. They both had eyes for the throne. They both desired to be in control at whatever the cost may be. Friend, I am patiently tracing something and I pray that the Spirit of God will illuminate your inner eyes in Jesus’ name.\nThirdly, they both trusted those who will adulate or worship their rebellion and strong desire for self-seeking glory. They both love to deflect God’s glory to themselves. Perhaps, you are fresh in the ministry, or God is called you into divine labour, please never try to touch, take or share God’s glory or praise. For the day you dare attempt to take His glory, His presence will depart from you. All they wanted was the crown and the throne. They both had an uncontrollable appetite for power and popularity. And were ready to demand it at whatever cost. Even the death of innocent souls. But, you will see that even after the death of Absalom David did not hastily or forcefully push for his return to the throne. He rather humbly left the matter into the hands of the Lord to perfect it. This, I counsel here must be your attitude as a child of God.\nFourthly, it is instructive to mention that God is supreme and pre-eminent. And right from the Garden of Eden, through the pages of the Bible, the kingdom of darkness is always in contention for control and power. There seems to be a continuous challenge against the sovereignty of God. Satan and his cohorts are constantly in a serious battle against the Kingdom of light. And God be praised for He alone reigns supreme over the heaven and the earth.\nNow, the picture of Absalom was first quietly mentioned 2Sam.13:1, 20-29. And his seemingly passive response to the rape of his sister Tamar indicated being kind and gentlemanly. For he said to the sister, ‘Well my sister, keep quiet for now since he’s your brother. Don’t, worry about it.’ But silently in his heart, he detested Amnon. For the Bible says that ‘for Absalom hated Amnon…’. (v22). No wonder the saying that, ‘the name the parent will give the child is only known to them’. However, what gives me concern is the blind and weak response of King David to the matter. Although he was wroth when he heard about the rape incident but he did not judge the evil act of rape and incest. What sort of a father will turn a blind eye to such abomination? Rather he did not discipline his son Amnon for he loved him being the firstborn and the supposed heir to the throne.\nAs I trace this whole chronicle, I observed that another possibility was that as an adulterer himself (see 2Sam.11:1-12:24), David considered himself in no rightful position to punish his own son’s sexual sin. Another possibility is that David thought this was God’s “an eye for an eye” punishment or consequence for his own sexual indiscretion and the tragic death of Uriah, Bathsheba’s husband. (2Sam.12:9-12).\nSo, what I can see is that although God has forgiven David for his sin of adultery and his hand in the death of Uriah, he was nonetheless not spared from the consequences of his sins. Friend, you have to bear in mind that though God, is loving and faithful, he is equally just and disciplined God. For no sinner will go unpunished. The terminal and strictest judgment of sin is death. Paul said in Romans 6:23, ‘the wages of sin is death. Please note that this refers to both physical and spiritual death.\nThere is only one thing that separates, hides, and keeps God’s face away from any man. That thing is non-other than ‘SIN’. Beloved, no matter how little or seemingly harmless is your sin, please note that God can neither condone nor wink at it! Whether yours is a white lie, or exaggeration of a matter, whether it is pornography or masturbation, perhaps yours is stealing of your employer’s time, adultery -sex outside marriage, one thing is certain, sin is sin, small or big, hidden or open. Remember, that your sin will find you out. (Num.32:23).\nFriend, the actual picture I intend to present to you here is the intrinsic nature of the kind of life that Absalom carried. I would have you know that although the consequence of his father, David’s sin with Bathsheba and subsequently the death of Uriah, has a significant reason for all his rebellion and disobedience, he was nevertheless dominated and controlled by the sinful nature hence he thought to do evil in his heart-to kill Amnon, his half-brother who raped the sister Tamar in revenge. The scripture says in James 1:20 that, ‘For the anger of a man does not work the righteousness of God.’ Human anger like that of Absalom does not by any means produce or reflect the desires and purposes of God. For vengeance is God’s and not Absalom. Even if the father, David failed to judge the sin, it is not in the moral and spiritual standing of Absalom to murder another man. No wonder his vengeful action escalated the situation beyond redemption because infliction of injury or like on any other person does not put any man right with God. It is the Gospel (Christ in you) that changes a man. (Rom.1:16-17)\nYou must understand that God in His plan wanted man to bear about the life-light to keep the darkness at bay. He created mankind so that we can shine the life light and establish His Kingdom’s purpose here on earth. Mankind was to carry God’s life-light inside this container called body. Man is only a container and God inside man, is the content only. The Lord’s original concept of ministry has not changed (Phil. 2:13). It is Christ in you and me that is the life-light and the true representative of God on earth. But there is also a representative of the prince of darkness who is much around looking for preys to terminate the life-light. Please note that the body has never been the problem but the species of life the man carries inside.\nThe original plan of God is for man to exercise dominion by shinning the life-light about. But something tragic happened in the Garden of Eden when the woman and the husband were deceived by the devil to take the fruit from the forbidden tree. (2Cor.11:3). So, after Adam and Eve fell, man lost the glory inside of him (Rom3:23). Even though he still carries about the same body but the life-light has automatically departed the man God originally formed. Mankind became another man so to say, even though he did not physically fall and die, but suffered spiritual death, i.e., (corruption) occurred to his soul-mind, will and emotion. This death terminated the life-light and quietly introduced what the bible called The Old Man.\n ","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2021-05-02-absalom-is-dead-1/","title":"Absalom is Dead 1"},{"categories":["Podcasts"],"contents":"How you can endure the present profaned and corrupt world by living above sin is the focus of this conversation with Bro.

The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?” (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)\nThen Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?” (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)\n The first issue in this quoted text is Peter’s weapon of defence. This to me is very significant for our lesson. Discuss the significance of Peter’s sword. What kind of sword are you still trusting in? Is your sword financial principle, economic or religious principle? Watch out you might be trusting in your own strength like Peter, yet you are a Christian or disciple. The next critical question is; what cup was JESUS referring to here? What was in this cup? Why was this cup presented to Him, and not others in the Garden of Gethsemane? Why was He so particular in drinking this cup? Why was it necessary for Him to drink it? This is a big mystery!  To briefly explain this, let us first examine Hebrew 10:5 account;\nTherefore, when he cometh into the world, he said, “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for me.\nThis verse indicates the complete obedience of CHRIST’s Priesthood and His faithful sacrifice on the Cross. He was speaking about His willingness to yield His body for us on the Cross as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. And how can these things be except He has a body in our likeness – be willing, be living and be holy? Though, the body is a container, there must not be a vacuum. Therefore, it was necessary that it must be filled with a “certain content” as it were. But, how would this content enter the prepared and pre-ordained body of JESUS? This is another Mystery!\nSo, as touching the mystery of the cup, His complete obedience to willingly yield His body informs us that the sinful nature needs to be dealt with in this same body like ours. That is why Isa. 53:4-6 says, “He was wounded for our transgressions… He was bruised for our iniquities…” And what does this mean?\nTo answer this and other questions mentioned in this section above, let us look at The Living Bible (TLB) rendition of 2 Cor. 5:21**_ – “For GOD took the sinless Christ and poured into him our ‘sins’. Then, in exchange, he poured GOD’s goodness into us!” _**\nFrom the three scriptures above, it seems GOD took the cup while JESUS was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, stood before Him and presented to Him the ‘cup.’ What was this cup? It was the cup of ‘our sins’ – my iniquities and your iniquities. It was the cup of our sinful works – of my lies, your pride, my jealousy, your anger etc.\nIT WAS THE CUP OF GOD’S FURY AND UNDILUTED WRATH that we all deserve because of our sins and disobedience. This cup signifies that His death was the portion given to him by GOD; the portion He took to redeem sinners (you and I) unto GOD. For us all, JESUS willingly drank this content of this cup and was baptised with this baptism of death. It was the cup of judgment against the soul that sinneth. And having presented it to him (as the perfect sacrifice), JESUS took the cup and drank it. He did not need to drink the cup of each of us one by one. This is because it is the same Old Man – Adamic nature – producing different iniquities in each of us (Rom.5:15-18).\nSo, GOD in His infinite wisdom needed just one right person, and an acceptable living, willing sacrifice to bear in His body the griefs, sorrows and particularly the judgment and the wrath of us all – Isa. 53:6. Inside that mysterious cup presented to JESUS to drink was my old man and your old man. This is the Adamic nature that is jealousy in A; anger in B; lying in C and pride in D. Then, CHRIST swallowed the whole content of the cup. At this point, JESUS was already sorrowful and drenched as with sweat drops of blood. Thus, when He swallowed the whole content of the cup, He became an embodiment of our sins as it were, so that we might condemn sin in the body physically on the Cross. This is the reason JESUS came. It is the summit of the Gospel. This is the mystery of our deliverance from Mr. Flesh. To take away the curse of our sins. JESUS came purposely to execute GOD’s will. Then, said he, Lo, I come to do thy will O, GOD. He taketh away the first Adam, that He may establish the second. By the which we are sanctified ‘through’ the offering (DEATH) of the body of JESUS Christ once and for all” – Hebrews 10: 9-10 KJV.\n“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree…” Gal.3:13\nHe did this so that we might be saved from the curse of sin and the world system, and from the wrath and fury of GOD’s judgment for our sins. Equally, at this point, GOD’s will become accomplished! (Luke. 22:42; John. 12:27). What was troubling the Adamic race was FINISHED, before JESUS finally gave up His spirit into the hands of GOD. He painfully waited for the Adamic sinful nature – Mr. Flesh to die, before He bowed His head committing His spirit to the Lord.\nThis means that the price of sin is DEATH. And you must completely hand over the old man in your life to the Lord at the Cross. Your whole spirit, soul and body must be yielded voluntarily to GOD for the evacuation and termination of the Adamic sinful nature before GOD can generously pour His Spirit into you in exchange. And only a dead man is freed from the curse sin. You cannot carry any curse into the presence of God. It was this huge price that CHRIST paid for you and me on the Cross at Calvary. Are you willing to do the same for Him? This must be settled here before your life can be wholly, living and pleasing vessel unto GOD. JESUS did this, so that, we don’t have to be offering any useless sacrifice to be freed from our sins. In addition, so that we don’t have to physically die to be freed from the tyranny of sin in the flesh. JESUS did it once and for all. (Heb. 9:26,29; 2Pet.3:9). Halleluiah!\nWHAT HAS CHRIST DEATH ACCOMPLISHED FOR YOU?\n Through His death on the Cross, JESUS terminated the Adamic nature. (Rom. 6:6). When CHRIST died on the Cross, Satan’s power of death was broken forever. (Heb. 2:14-15). Through His death on the Cross, CHRIST destroyed the works of the devil. (1 John 3:8b) When CHRIST died on the Cross, Satan’s head was crushed. (Gen. 3:15) When He died on the Cross, the devil’s captives were released. (Luke 4:18) When CHRIST died on the Cross, the principalities and powers, rulers of darkness, demons were disarmed, dislodged, discomfited. (Col. 2:15) As a result of the Cross, Satan’s doom is now guaranteed. (John 12:31, John 16:11; Rev. 20:10) When CHRIST died on the Cross, our old man died with Him; so that we should no longer serve sin and Satan. (Rom.6:6). When CHRIST died on the Cross, He terminated the un-holy relationship, control and dominion we had with our former ‘husband’ – the old man. Since death is the cessation of any marriage, CHRIST’s death secured our freedom – Rom. 7:1-4.

I am glad to write this new year welcome message for this new and living way.\nAs we begin this year 2021, I see a great opportunity to reflect on the major lessons learnt last year 2020. This New Year is one that you must bear in mind that life cannot return suddenly to normal as usual. You must be prepared for the ‘New Normal’. This is because the earth has begun her journey to the end!\nFor, “If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men (and covid-19) rose up against us, then they (it) would have swallowed us alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; but our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth”. (Psalms 124:2-3,8)\nWhat an amazing grace of God that saw us through the unprecedented challenges in 2020. A year characterized with uncertainties, anxieties, untimely deaths, financial crisis, insecurities, fears, terrible covid-19 pandemic and its debilitating effects, but we praise the name of the Lord, that there is still real hope as we have crossed over into 2021.\nIn Mk 4:35, I saw Jesus telling the disciples that their time on this side is done and it is time for them to cross over unto the other side. I see year 2021 as year of expansion, enlargement and increase. It will be a year of transitioning and moving into the next position that Heaven has for you. A year of going across to the side of the Lord. A year of drawing closer to the Lord in every aspect of your life.\nThere will be a passing over this year and you need to get ready for it. Heaven will be moving you into your next position inside Christ and His word. And you will agree with me that it is thus, imperative that you should no longer be complacent in this New Year. No more room for complacency and compromise. You must now walk daily in one accord with the Lord, who is our PASSOVER LAMB!\nIt is a passing over from slavery to sin, from sinful pleasures and carnality into the side of godliness, holiness and righteousness. And the divine means of Passover is the CROSS. For without an encounter with the Cross, the Blood of the Paschal Lamb and the Man of Calvary, there is no genuine Passover. This pass over is a going over into deliverance, great expansion, enlargement increase. Please note that we have passed over into the realm of the Unstoppable move of Jehovah.\nIn fact, whenever God is talking about a going over, it usually begins with a quiet and growing dissatisfaction about one’s current position and the need to move over to the right side. As you start to experience this in the New Year, count it not strange nor be careless or casual about it. Instead, you would need to cultivate it, feed it and watch it grow. (This is briefly discussed below as you read on). The Year 2021, is a year that as you cross over that the prophetic words will find their fulfilment. Let me quickly ask, have you crossed over yet? Or you are still vacillating?\nSo, as the world system is preparing for the arrival of the anti-christ, we the children of God must go over the Lord side and await His glorious appearing and second coming. We must be watchful, prayerful, faithful, grateful as we cross over to the New Year.\n_ What would be the characteristics of this Passover? What will be your own part in it?_\n1. There will be the sending away of the multitude – vs 36a\nNot everyone will understand or be part of this passing over. While it is good to discuss it and be comfortable with the multitude, one characteristics of this Passover is that you will have to let go of the multitude and cling on the beatitudes. The multitude must not hinder or delay your following of Jesus: you will need to follow Jesus even if alone. Your following Jesus must be deliberate, intimate and personal. You will also have to let go off the multitude in your use of time, resources, privilege etc. You must cast off the restraint of multitudes of time wasters like unnecessary phone calls, worthless conversations, chats, hypocrisy, and fables. You need to cast them off so that you can travel light on the Calvary Road in the New Year 2021.\n2. There will be the deliberate entering into ship(s) – vs 36b\nAfter the disciples have sent away the multitude, they entered into the ship with Jesus and there were also other ships with Him. Likewise, for this Passover, you will need to deliberately enter with Jesus into the ‘ship(s)’ that will convey you unto the other side. You will need to be deliberate and particular about it, without distraction, without sentiment, without entertainment. You will need to enter into the ‘ship(s)’ with Him. These ‘ship(s)’ are the ship of ‘DiscipleSHIP’; of ‘FellowSHIP’; of ‘RelationSHIP’; of strategic and profitable ‘FriendSHIP’ or ‘CompanionSHIP’ with godly like minds. That is, those who will sharpen you and convey you to the other side together with the Master.\nYou will need to take your discipleship serious; give much attention and focus with your fellowship with the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit and with the brethren; build and maintain profitable relationship and make friend of the Word of God and life-building materials.\n3. There will be storms/waves which will come to test and build your faith (vs 37 – 41)\nIt is absolutely clear that the devil is never happy with New beginnings. He is our adversary all the time. He never gives up. He is the enemy of going forward. He is always looking for whom to devour. He is unruly, stubborn and rebellious. Imagine, that after the multitude of distractions were sent away and they entered the boats, that the storm came up! Can you imagine that?\nOne thing that usually accompanies passing over/transition are trials, tests, troubles, unbelief, doubts, loneliness, that will come to prove and build your faith (vs 37). The children of Israel had their share of these trials/challenges on their Passover into the Promised Land. Unfortunately, they repeatedly failed these trials and unnecessarily prolonged and postponed their entry into the Promised Land. May you not fail in your time of test and trials in Jesus name. May grace and truth of God attend to you all through the storms of life in Jesus name.\nLikewise, you will need to prepare for storms and challenges that will come your way as if to sink your ship and drown you in the waters of this world. You are reading this message because the Lord did not permit the covid-19 storms and its catastrophic effects to subdue you last year. Hence, the necessity to stay on the Lord’s side (to stay in the same …SHIP with Jesus.\nBe rest assured that storms will certainly come, ferociously and threatening you. However, your perspective is important at this point. You must stay positive and attentive, because they have only come to stretch, sharpen your horizon, fortify your inner strength and prepare your faith for what lies ahead of you on the other side. As such, when they come, never doubt the presence of Jesus with you nor question His care and compassion for you (vs 38). Instead, exercise your faith and put it to use; instead look unto Jesus, the Master over storms and wind. No matter how little you feel your faith is; that faith is just enough to take you out to safety. In the name of Jesus, speak to the wind, the wave and they will hear you (vs39).\nYou must refuse to be afraid. And put on your shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. If you obey all these instructions, you will be surprised with the great results that will locate you. (vs 41).\nFriends, this year 2021 will be a year of passing over/transitioning into what God has planned for you. There will be a moving over from where you are now to where He has pre-ordained for you.\nIt is a year of maximizing divine opportunities. It is a year of maximizing the purging of the Church of God. It is a year of returning of the prodigal sons and daughters into the Church. A year of breaking denominational barriers in the Body of Christ. It is a year of divine outburst, so we must all press on towards the path of righteousness for his name sake. It is a year of unstoppable move of the power and purpose of God. It is a season of divine multiplication (fruitfulness) that will remain. It is a season of divine presence. It is also a year of parallel events happening in the world and in the Church. So, we the Church must stay focus on God side.\nTherefore, I welcome you into a new chapter Year 2021 (Mk 5:1). A new chapter with a new identity and testimony.\nIn conclusion, let us briefly look again at the key words in Mk 4:35b:\n“… Let us pass over unto the other side.” – Mark 4:35 (KJV)\n Let: A call to action; a call to allow, permit; an imperative command in the first or third person. Us: You will not be alone in this journey. It is US – Christ and you. He promised to be with you on this journey to the other side. He will not leave you alone. Pass over: This year will be a year of passing over, transitioning, into what God has in plan for you next. A year of movement; of crossing over. It means deliverance from bondage to freedom in order to worship the Lord in spirit and truth. The other side: Not this side but the other side. Not the side you are now but the other side across the sea. Not your current position but where God wants you to be next.  PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTS TO FOLLOWING JESUS TO THE OTHER SIDE.\nBelow, are few practical means of seeking the Lord and growing in Him through your peculiar kind of …SHIP.\n THE WORD OF GOD-It is through God’s word that you can seek to know Him better now that you have crossed over to the other side-2021. It is God’s word that testifies about Him. (Heb.11:3; 2Tim.3:16-17; Jh 5:39; 2Cor.3:18; 2Pet 1:3-4). For your inheritance at the other side is packaged in the Word of God that has transited you to the New side. E.g., Abraham Gen12:1-3; Jesus Luke 4:17-19, Mary Luke 1:26-38. Nothing else but the Word of God. PRAYER– Exo 31:18; Luke 11:1-11; Isaiah 26:3, Phil 4:6-7, Luke 6:12-13; Eph. 6:18 FASTING-To abstain from food or other pleasures for a period of time for Kingdom Purpose. See Dan 9:2-3; 10:3. (Fasting must not be done arbitrarily or as a self-imposed religious exercise but as led by the Lord with Prayer, Praise and worship. PRACTICAL OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD. This is another key implement to cultivating, irrigating and fertilizing your spiritual life in the New Year. E.g., Heb 3:17-18, 5:7-8; Gen.12:1-4; Isa. 1:19 etc FellowSHIP with the other belivers-Heb.10:24-25; Eph. 2:18-19; Psa. 133:1-3. DiscipleSHIP: – This you would agree with me is yet a very crucial means of growing in the New year with the Lord. It is an important secret implement to obtaining the hidden treasures of the Kingdom of God. See Gen. 2:8; Gal. 4:1-4; 1 Sam. 3:1-11: Acts 6:1-3; Mk. 3:13-15; Matt.5:1-2 etc.  In Conclusion, for you not to stagnate in the New year, you MUST desire to pursue the knowledge of the Lord and have Him as your eternal portion.

Since anything that comes with the sinful nature cannot please God, it means that God had a plan to deal with sins and the sinful nature. God truly does not want to bestow unending fame upon Mr. flesh at all. So, He made adequate provision for us to experience total deliverance from it. By God’s mercy, there is an end to the activities of Mr. flesh and Old Man himself.\nThe flesh cannot be suppressed and pampered. Even the legalism cannot deal with Mr. Flesh. So, for God to be warning man of the consequence of hell, and He has no way of escape for the man, then it would be vague to point it to man. For if there is no way out of the danger of indulging in the activities of the sinful nature, then our Gospel is weak and vain. But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the redemption in the Blood of Jesus!\n1.1 FIRST PROVISION- THE BLOOD PROVISION\nKey Texts: (Lev. 17:1-8; 17:11; Heb. 9:10-12 NIV**).**\nThe Lord said to Moses, “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord has commanded… This is so the Israelites will bring to the Lord the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the Lord, at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings.  The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.  They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.’\n __“Say to them: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice and does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the Lord must be cut off from the people of Israel.\n“‘I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood, and I will cut them off from the people.  For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.\nFrom Lev. 17 above, only the High Priest can atone for peace offering before the LORD. When a man sins against his body or another person, he had done so against the LORD, who is the Head of the body. So, for a sinner man to have fellowship with God, he must acknowledge his sins, confess, repent from his sins and turn away. Therefore, the blood is primarily for GOD. Hence, GOD provided the blood of JESUS as a means for our daily deliverance from sins. Jesus shed His blood once and for all for mankind. JESUS is now both our HIGH PRIEST and SACRIFICIAL LAMB cf. Heb. 9:11-12; 10: 5-14; 19-22 (NLT).\nPlease note the Scripture in Heb. 10:22 which says that, the Blood of JESUS cleanses our hearts from an evil conscience. This is because our heart [which cannot be cleansed but requires an exchange] is desperately wicked and deceitful (Jer.17:9 KJV).\nConsequently, the solution, is a new heart (Ezek. 36:26 NKJV). For example, do you wash and iron the garment you are going to throw away into the bin? No, you wouldn’t because there is no need to. What this infers is that an un-regenerated heart does not need renovation, retouching or repainting, but a replacement. A complete change of heart and new nature is what you need. This means that you ask God to change your heart and renew the right spirit within you.\nDISCUSSION POINT\n From the key texts above, discuss the Old Testament priesthood activities of animal sacrifice for atonement and its implication to you and many in the Church of God today. From the above, do you think that GOD was being arbitrary when He demanded for blood sacrifice from sinners as atonement for their sins? How many times or for how long do you think a sinner will have to bring to the priest animal (blood) sacrifice as atonement for his sins? What do you think would have been the implication of this if GOD did not send JESUS to pour out His soul once and for all to cleanse us from our sins?  1.2 Further Gleaning:\na. John 1:29 “The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\nb. See also 1 John 1:9 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\n Compare and contrast the two passages above. To whom was John the Baptist referring to? And was it a misprint of the use of ‘sin’ (singular) and not ‘sins’ (plural)? If you agree with whom John the Baptist was referring to in v29, do you now believe that God has made available provision for your deliverance from sins before the foundation of the earth? (Rev.13:8; 5:9) Why do you think many believers today are still following the old traditional rites of animal sacrifices as a means of atonement? Can this please GOD?  It is important for you to know that, as powerful as the blood of JESUS is to remove all sins, it can NOT deal with Mr. Flesh. Not that it is weak, but that it was not provided to deal with sin, but its products. For God has made alternative provision for dealing with the sinful nature. This we shall study in the next lesson.\nAs I have also discovered, the power of sin is not actually in sin, but in its power to separate a man from the Lord. Sin has the power to remove divine immunity from the child of God who makes sin a practice. If God was to mark our iniquity, no man can stand before Him. For all our righteousness is like a filthy rag. Even the anger of a man cannot work the righteousness of God (James 1:20).\nTherefore, the Blood provision is not only for sinners and weak people. It equally for the strong man or woman for as long as he/she confesses and repents from sin. Man must humble himself before the Lord so that he may obtain mercy and forgiveness of sins.\nFriend, no matter the number of sacrifices, and the cost, it cannot cleanse away your sins. Not even fasting, charitable deeds, weeping, gifts can undo or cleanse you from sins, but the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. This is the First provision for our deliverance from sins.\nSins must be confessed and genuinely repented from; if not, you will not make progress in life. (Prov. 28:13). No formula, theory or strategy can wash away your sins or appease the stubborn and unruly nature of the Old Man. It is the omission of this truth that has made many to become deliverance candidates. And this is the bane of average church-goer today.\nPeople are searching for a quick fix to their problems. There is no quick fix in the Bible to the matter of washing away of your sins. The only answer is the Blood of JESUS! It is priceless, spotless and faultless (1Pet.1:18-19). It is pure and powerful. It speaks better things than the blood of Abel. It saves, protects, speaks, heals, preserves, gives us access to GOD and purifies our conscience from sins. (Heb. 10:22). Please reflect on the lyrics of this hymn below:\n   What can wash away my sin?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\nWhat can make me whole again?\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.        \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Oh! precious is the flow\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; That makes me white as snow;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; No other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;     Let us now look at why the blood of Jesus is effective to wash away our sins.  1.3 The Efficacies of the Blood of Jesus\n  The blood is offered primarily to appease GOD – Lev. 17:1-6, Heb. 9:11-12 (KJV); to remove the effects of sin that we obtain forgiveness.\n  The blood is so effective in cleansing us from our sins – 1John 1:7, 9 (KJV);\n  It also gives us access to GOD; it purifies our consciences – Heb. 10:22 (KJV);\n  The blood of Jesus restores us to God upon true repentance from our sins. (Heb.10:9)\n  We have fellowship with GOD by the Blood of JESUS – 1John 1:7 (NKJV); (We now experience a progressive and continuous cleansing.\n  It speaks better things than the blood of Abel – Heb. 12:24 (NKJV);\n  It acts as an inter-phase between us and GOD so that we can have communion with Him. (Exo. 29:44)\n  By the blood of the Lamb, we overcame the devil – Rev 12:11 (KJV);\n  The Blood of Jesus confirms that our sins are forgiven. Eph. 1:7 (GNB)\n  It took away from us the guilt of sins (Rom. 8:1-4).\n  The blood of Jesus now sustains and suspends the judgment of God until our sanctification is complete. Even our holiness (sanctification) does not downplay the efficacy of the blood of Jesus.\n  Through the blood of Jesus, we now have a new and living way to God. (Heb. 10:20).\n  According to Col. 2:14, the blood of Jesus blotted out and still blots out all the unfavourable records of our wrongdoings, and renders the devil charges filed against us null and void.\n  The Blood of Jesus is also for our deliverance, healing and protection.\n  Discuss further the efficacy of the blood as provision for our deliverance from sins using these texts – ( 26:27-28; Acts 20:28; Col. 1:20; Ephes. 1:7; Heb. 9:14; 9:22; 10:19; 13:12; 1Jhn. 1:7; Lk. 22:20; Rev. 1:5; 12:11).\n  ","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2020-12-18-mystery-of-godliness-10/","title":"Mystery of Godliness 10"},{"categories":["Articles","Featured"],"contents":"KEY TEXT: Rev. 12:10-11 (NKJV). So, for you to overcome the devil and his constant accusations, it is not by your own effort but by the “Blood of the Lamb and by the Word of your testimony.”\n It is not by shouting; talking about it; not by speaking in tongues; not by covering it up. But by acknowledging it, by genuine confession, true repentance and the appropriation of the Blood of JESUS. As you draw nearer to GOD, the light of His Word exposes any darkness within us; then, we become convicted.   Then, through faith in the Blood provision, the LORD (by His Spirit) cleanses us from our sins.  HANDLING THE ACCUSER\nThe most common weapon used by our accuser is condemnation or guilt. The Bible says that he accuses us before GOD day and night (Rev.12:10). But thanks be to GOD for the Word of Testimony which says, “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death. (Rom. 8:1) KJV\nSo, in reality when the Devil accuses us, we must note that this is his job. He is both the accuser and the resister. For example, the devil will say, “See you, and you call yourself a believer, but you have just lied to your boss; and yesterday you also lied to your wife. The next lie is to your children. You are covering up because of being found out. Do you see yourself? Liar! Shame on you!”\nSo, what must you do? When you are confronted with such blatant accusation, it is instructive that you do not try to help yourself. Do not entertain self-defence, but draw nearer to the Cross and deeper to His precious bleeding side in faith. This is where God’s love and mercy can find you. Also, you must have confidence in the accomplished power of the Blood of Jesus and His Cross for your daily deliverance.\nThe other common error of judgment is that we accept the devil’s condemnation or guilt, which plunges us deeper into self-condemnation or guilt trip. This is the root cause of discouragement and despair among believers.\nConsequently, as we embark on these two faulty ways, our reasoning becomes weak and our tender conscience becomes impaired. Then our sense of GOD becomes so obscured. Finally, we become separated from the LORD, and guilt sets into our mind like a mighty terrible flood beyond our control.\nBut when we turn to the LORD, look to the Cross through faith in Christ accomplished work of redemption by the blood of His everlasting covenant and by His Word of testimony, we experience constant deliverance from the accuser (the devil). (Heb. 12:2; Rev. 12:10-11; Rom. 8:33-34. NKJV, NIV, NLT, GNT). Check other translations.\n** PRACTICAL DISCUSSIONS:**\n What do you do when you are accused falsely?

(1Thess. 5:23).   THE SPIRIT (Consist of our Intuition, fellowship and conscience) \u0026#8211; The Generating/Manufacturing Centre.  THE SOUL (Comprises of our Intellect, Will and Emotion \u0026#8211; The Warehouse.  THE BODY (feelings show itself through the Vent. i.e. hands, eyes, mouth \u0026#8211; The Retail Outlets.  1.2: Three Major Vents of dead works   In Our Thoughts: [Matt. 12:24-25,31; Isa. 55:6-7; Matt. 5:27-28; Matt. 15:19].  In Our words: [Prov. 10:19 MSG, AMP, ERV; Matt. 12:36-37 MSG, ERV; Eph. 4:29 NKJV, ERV].  In Our Deeds/Actions: [Gal. 5:19-21; Col. 3:5-9; Matt. 5:23-24; 6:14-15]   THOUGHTS DECISION DEEDS/ACTION   MIND WILL EMOTIONS/FEELINGS  On the outside, it seems that nothing happened because the container (body covering) remains the same, and this is the reason why men continue to multiply iniquity. But on the inside, another man has taken over called Mr. Flesh. At this stage, the fallen man goes about with activities of the flesh. The reason is that the soul (the distribution centre) has become decayed and contaminated with dead works. Some of the dead works listed in Gal. 5:19-21 are activities of the degenerated spirit of the fallen man. Even though the standard of God was righteousness, yet the fallen man could not do what was right because it cannot. The flesh cannot serve God and at the same time, it cannot inherit the Kingdom of God (Rom 8:5-8).  1.3 The Works, and Manifestations of Human nature.   What the human nature or the flesh does is quite plain or obvious. It loves to show itself in diverse ways and diverse places. Be it in the workplace, in the church, in the fellowship, in the prayer room, in the political parties, in the market place or school. There is a person behind the manifestation of the dead works, who is called the Old Man. He has many aliases; Carnal Man, Sinful man, Human Nature, Natural Man etc.  So, whenever you notice the manifestation of the human nature in you, do not explain it away or rationalise it. Do not even begin to speak in tongues or give excuses. Do not pretend that it is not there, because it cannot be hidden, for it shows itself. Your first and foremost labour is to expose it. This is because anything that comes with Mr. flesh cannot please God. The effects of the activities of Mr. flesh can be devastating. It contaminates the whole body if you keep silent about it. Remember, it shows itself….!  For example, if you used to be short-tempered or proud under the former owner-occupier, but now you find that in a church meeting or family meeting the anger resurfaces, you do not need to wait any longer to see that it is still there. Your immediate response is to go back to God in prayer for deliverance from it. This sinful nature can show itself in idolatry, in pride, during song ministration and even in sermon ministration. It is capable of doing not only bad things but good things as well.  All the management courses on self-esteem, self-aggrandisement, self-control, self-development, self-will are all manifestations of human nature. When you discover that you are too proud to simply say \u0026#8216;I am sorry\u0026#8217; whether you are wrong or not, you are seeing Mr. Self showing itself. All matters of cover-up, deception, manipulation, intimidation and control are simply witchcraft, which is a manifestation of human nature. Do you remember when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden of Eden? They justified and defended themselves. They apportioned blames. Adam apportioned blame on Eve. Eve in turn apportioned blame of Satan. All these are activities of human nature.  Self loves to impress men, even in spiritual matters. It can organise prayer and fasting with long vigil. It is the one behind tradition, culture, religion, superstitions, native wisdom, honour killing, media, entertainment, sports etc.. Self loves to puff up in the public. The same self is behind the aspect of insecurity, over supervision, rules and regulations. Where you see too many rules and regulations, the self is in charge. Self always insists on \u0026#8216;my own way or nothing.\u0026#8217;  Self is the one behind polygamy (marrying more than one wife). Self is behind adultery and fornication in the church. It is a full-blown sin virus that is ravaging and damaging the church today. Self is also behind seductive dressing by women which captivate and capture men on the pulpit. This human nature is not your friend but your enemy. You must lay it bare at the Cross.  1.4 What is God’s verdict on the human nature?   [John 3:3, 5-6, Deut. 21:18-21, 1Pet.1:18, Rom. 8:6-8]   Questions a. The verdict of God to human nature is not a replacement. It is not a renovation, not rebranding, not restructuring or re-strategizing. It is simple and plain. What is it then? See Job 14:14, 1Jh. 3:8, Rev. 21:8.  b. Is it possible for that which is born of the flesh to be managed and supervised along with the kingdom of God? c. Study Deut. 21:18-21 and Rom. 8:6-8 again. Discuss what you discovered about your human nature. d. Can the flesh inherit the kingdom of God? If No, why not? e. Why must you not pamper, cajole, hide and cherish the human nature? f.

Sin drew away the sinless life from this container (our body) and another life (sinful nature) invaded this human body. None of us saw the first Adam (in Gen. 2; 1, Cor.15:45).\nSo, what this means is that we inherited our sinful nature from the fallen man of Gen. 3. (Gen. 3:7-10, 12-13; Gen. 5:1-3 NKJV). Consequently, God is continually looking for a man who will perpetuate His divine purpose on the earth. This is because there was a quiet change in our original nature (in Gen. 2) after the fall of man. The fallen nature of man is the kind of specie of life he carried after the fall. A life that is corrupt, proud, disobedient, given to blames, excuses, cover-up and is totally selfish!\nPointer: The issue is that GOD is committed to making man with the light-life to replenish the earth, to legislate the Kingdom’s light-life and to drive away the darkness. But satan has committed himself to hijack this original concept and to cut it short. The reason is that Satan cannot create man, hence, all these aggressive researches into AI [WHAT IS ‘AI?], human digital technology and corruption through sin is to make man to serve him too.\nSo, when it seems that Satan is claiming that he has hijacked man and achieved his evil purpose through sin and disobedience, GOD decided to send JESUS, His only Begotten Son to come into this world in the likeness of human flesh to be the perfect sacrifice to die for our sins (Rom. 8:3 NIV; 2 Cor.5:21; Heb.2:14; 4:15). This will lead us to the examples of dead works.\n** 1.2 BIBLICAL EXAMPLES OF DEAD WORKS TO BURY**\nStudy Texts: (Gal. 5:19-21; 2Cor. 12:20-21; 1Cor. 6:8-10; Rom 1:25-32; Rev. 21:8, Rev. 21:27; 22:15).\n ****Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal. 5:19-21) AKJV.\nWhat human nature does is quite plain: It shows itself in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions; _in worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups; they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before: those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God**. (Gal. 5:19-21 GNT**)_\nFor I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: ** **and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed. (2Cor. 12:20-21 AKJV)\nNay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (1Cor.6:8-10 AKJV)\nYou will notice a list of few dead works in the passages above. They are examples of dead works to be repented from: They are dead works because there is no life in them. Dead works are anything we do or any thought that we think upon which are not initiated by God. Whatever anyone does without the Holy Spirit behind it, or at work is but a dead work.\n1.3 Dead works can be grouped into 2 main categories.  Everything we did in the flesh before we came to Christ. It includes sins or works of the flesh dictated to us by the Old man. It means the works of the devil (1John 3:8). It is as simple as even church attendance, church ceremonies or church traditions done to earn the favour of God or man. It includes things we have done based on church rules and regulations, even though it seems reasonable or acceptable, but actually they are according to the law and not grace. The second category is everything we do upon conversion that is void of the life-giving spirit of God – Rev.3:1-2; 2Sam.24:10, Exo.2:11-12. Whatever we do that is not initiated and endorsed by the Holy Spirit; and that is not from the Word of God, but the wisdom of men – is of this second category. It also includes church activities and church programmes that are without the unction of God.  We inherited this fallen nature in the garden of Eden through Adam and Eve. Though it seemingly looks as if nothing happened, the spirit of man became corrupted and degenerated. It became alive to sin. (Read Gen. 3:22; 4:1-17, 19, 23; 5:1-3). The soul became filled and flooded with the sin virus. The sin virus is worse than the COVID-19 virus. And the body is the outlet manifesting the dead works. Hence, the Good News Translation says_, “What the human nature does is quite plain.”_\nIn these two translations, it presents the flesh as a person who works, and whose work is obvious, and quite plain to see. For example, when you see a piece of furniture, it is quite plain that it was made by a carpenter or interior designer. Equally, when you see a good dress, it is evident that it was made by a fashion designer and not a mechanic. That is why the scripture says, “By their fruits, you shall know them.” (Matt.7:16). You can identify what a man does by its works. Just as life shows itself, so does sin show itself by its dead works.\nYou may be able to hide a particular sin for 20-30 years (e.g. Jacob and Esau), but one day it will expose you. It does not matter the class of people present. Sin by its nature brings shame and disgrace. It terminates your relationship with God and with people. It is because by nature the Mr. Flesh loves to show itself. You cannot cover up the flesh for too long. It will disappoint you in public.\nThe flesh will always demand for what belongs to him. He is older and cleverer than you are. Therefore, expose him before it scatters all that you have built upon the foundations of lies and deceits. So, before it is too late, hand over yourself to God and confess your sins unto Him. In the NKJV, it gives us a list of these activities of Mr. Flesh: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred etc.. And the person who continually and habitually practice them, and others, though not mentioned here, will NOT inherit the Kingdom of GOD.\n ","date":":date_long","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","permalink":"/logbook/post/articles/2020-11-19-mystery-of-godliness-7/","title":"Mystery of Godliness 7"},{"categories":["Podcasts"],"contents":"Here, in part 3 of this Lockdown Episode on the Life of Moses in a difficult time in Egypt, we discovered the immense benefits of modelling Christ into the life of the child and the Young Person in their prime time.\nBut we soon concluded that for this to be possible, the guardian, parent must also have Christ.

This was because of the kind of life Nicodemus carried, but he was not aware of it. The problem with mankind is the specie of life he carries about in this earthen vessel. Mankind is not aware of the fallen nature dwelling within him, because nothing happened to the body (the container). But as he continually lives, he discovers that there is warfare (an inner struggle) within as touching his decision, emotions and feelings.\nSo, in this section, we shall discover the origin of this constant inner turmoil between the flesh and the spirit. We find that the desires of the fallen man are constantly opposed to that of the spirit. This brings a conflict of interest to mankind, so that the man is prevented from doing what he desired to do.\nTherefore, it is only GOD who can deliver a man from sin. God has made provisions for our deliverance – even from sins and sinful habits. The answer to the stubborn problem of the flesh is not in the legal codes or rules and regulations like: “Don’t touch this” – “Don’t drink this” – “Don’t watch this.” The Good news is that GOD has made the provisions for our daily living and victory from sin. But first, let us examine from the book of Galatians some examples of activities (products of the Old Man – Mr. Flesh) before looking at the provisions.\nOur dual problems were ‘sin’ and ‘sins.’ And we needed deliverance from them. The synonym of sins is iniquities (plural) and that of sin is iniquity (singular).\n1.1 Subsection (THE MEANING AND ORIGIN OF SIN): “Sins means the (products) of the sinful nature. And Sin means the (producer) or manufacturer of sins”. (Isaiah 53:5-6 AKJV)\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions,_\nhe was bruised (pierced) for our iniquities **(sins)**:\nthe chastisement of our peace was upon him;\nand with his stripes, we are healed.\n_ **_ _**_All we like sheep have gone astray;__\nwe have turned everyone to his own way;\nand the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity **(sin)** of us all._\n Questions for our learning:\n Who is the person being referred to in this verse? For what reason(s) was ‘he’ bruised or pierced? With what was the person being referred to in this verse being pierced? Was it a coincidence that the Bible distinguished between your iniquity and iniquities in these two verses? 1.2 THREE ASPECTS OF SIN    a) GOD’s aspect —– Habak. 1:13; Rom. 3:9-10. Sin violates God’s nature and eternal law. And God who is holy within and without cannot wink at sin, for He knows the nature of man. b) Man’s Aspect —– Luke 15:18; Gen.5:3. When a man falls into sin, it terminates and isolates him from God’s presence. So, the man went about multiplying offspring’s in his likeness and the image of the fallen nature. c) Satan’s Aspect —– Rev. 12:10-11; Job. 1:9-10. As a result of (b), the devil (our accuser) was cast down; for he constantly accuses man before GOD.  1.3 WHAT IS SIN? (1John 3:4; 5:17)  All unrighteousness is sin. Whoever sins also commits lawlessness. No man can undo or uncheck his sin. Sin is our enemy and God’s answer to the problem of sin is not by shouting, not by chatting, but by the instrumentality of the Cross.\nThis is why the teaching of the Cross is central to the Gospel and Christianity. The Gospel is about our redemption through CHRIST; our justification by his blood; the atoning sacrifice of His blood and our on-going repentance from sin. It is also our on-going sanctification through faith in what Christ has done for us and who He is.\nSin is an immoral act. It means to ‘MISS THE MARK’– an act of disobedience; a transgression of the law of GOD. It is the act of lawless passion. It is unruly, unbridled and unrestrained. And behind every confusion, chaos, disorder, an act of irresponsibility and anarchy is SIN!\nAny thought in the heart; every disobedience; evil intent of the mind; any word spoken or wrong act done against GOD (or man) – by despising His Person or grieving the Holy Spirit or by rejecting the Word of God is SIN.\n1.4 ORIGIN OF SIN. GOD’S divine nature is holiness within and without. And by His divine nature, He has the right to set standards for mankind’s righteousness – Rev. 4:11 KJV. Therefore, all mankind MUST account to Him for their actions, thoughts, and words done in this body. (Rom. 14:12; 1Pet. 4:5).\nThe first man and woman were innocent in the beginning. They were created by GOD as being sinless and good. They were creations of GOD bearing about His glory and light-life about. They were not afraid of the wild and ferocious beasts in the garden. There was no need to be afraid though because they were filled with His glory; for they were created in His image. (Gen. 1:27; 2:7 AKJV).\nGod use to come down in the cool of the day to fellowship with the man and the woman. They were used to the voice and presence of the Lord in the garden of Eden. The relationship they had with God was intimate and special. God’s presence with them consistently revealed to them the path of life; the man and the woman looked forward to the presence of God, which is the fullness of joy. All around Him was everlasting pleasures.\nHowever, they lost their innocence, perfection through disobedience [sin] and were driven out of the garden. They rejected the commandments of GOD when they took the forbidden fruit. Though they still lived, they had lost the glory, presence and protection of GOD. (Gen. 3:5, 6-7, 9, 10, 17-19 KJV). They became a mere living-corpse the moment they both ate the forbidden fruit. God passed his judgment upon them and the devil. God cursed the ground that bears fruit (the relationship of man to the ground became a sort of hostility as judgment fell upon the man’s primary role).\nThe Adamic race began to labour with a diminishing law of return, so to say. It is clear from here that the sin of mankind has extensive effects on creation – (Deut. 11:13-17, 28; Rom. 8:22; Gen. 4:12; 6:7) Though, the container remained un-bruised and un-wounded; though their eyes were opened; but to what would you say that their eyes were opened to; and to what extent is this curse of God on the relationship of man and the ground? (N: B The problem is never the container or the body, but the soul – which makes up of our thoughts, will and emotions). The natural man is the content inside the body. And disobedience with this natural man is intrinsic. He always struggles to obey God, but cannot, because of the innate carnal nature.\n Do you have a question, comment or prayer request?

Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!\nSee, your king comes to you,\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;righteous and victorious,\nlowly and riding on a donkey,\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;on a colt, the foal of a donkey. (NIV) He rode as a humble King triumphantly into Jerusalem. And when the evening was come, He continued His pilgrimage with His disciples – as if nothing grand happened during the day. The spiritual lesson here is that we must pack out of sight and mind the ashes of past glory and achievement – they belong to the past. Along with His disciples, He spent the night at Bethany. But the following morning when they departed from Bethany, the Master suddenly became hungry. Perhaps the streams of events of the previous day must have drained Him so much that He missed His dinner? Although this event happened so quickly as recorded in this account of the Gospel of Mark, our focus will be on the event in the next three verses from 12 to 14, following His great triumphant entry into Jerusalem.\nAs I discovered in this narrative story, Mark recorded that “when they left Bethany in the morning the following day, Jesus got hungry”. And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He moved closer if He could find any figs but He found NOTHING BUT LEAVES.\nBeloved, the issue for consideration in this article is not only that the fig tree has nothing but leaves, but the deceptive and misleading appearance. Hence, Jesus cursed the fig tree, saying that, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” This, to me, is a weighty and critical matter for our consideration.\nThis brief event is very central to our Christian faith. And there are several profound instructions and lessons for our spiritual maturity in this article. As Christians, we cannot afford to be careless and presumptuous with our inward lives. Our words must be congruent with our lives. There must not be a reason why the unbelievers will have occasion to doubt our conviction or character. It is as much a worry why the leaves of the fig trees were bright green, but there were no fruits at all. And sadly enough, this is actually even twice as much the lives of many church goers today. They are vibrant and flashy outside, but inside is ‘an open sepulchre’ white washed from the outside. They are warm with frenzy feeling outside, but very cold inside. They smile at you outside but are ravenous wolves inside.\nIt is my prayer that the Holy Spirit will illuminate your eyes to deep spiritual truths that we shall examine in this brief event, as recorded in the Mark account of the Gospel.\nAs I look at its implication to our lives, let me reiterate that my focus is not on faith or that the tree actually dried up. My first concern is the deceptive and misleading appearance of the fig tree. But before I discuss this, permit me to quickly draw your attention to the journey from Jerusalem unto Bethany.\nFriends, let it be known unto you that like Jesus and His twelve disciples, we are equally on a journey. Life is a pilgrimage filled with attendant needs, challenges, threats and opportunities. And you must be diligent to maximise each day as if it is the last.\nAs I read the New King James Version of Mark’s account of this event, it was striking to note that verse 12 began with ‘Now…’ And this is very important matter to me. The adverb ‘Now’ has diverse meanings; at present_, today, at this time, at this moment_etc. By these synonyms of ‘now’ it means that even though the event is past, about 2-3 thousand years ago, the instructions and lessons in this passage are still present and fresh to you on this pilgrimage today. It is therefore instructive for you to take heed to the events happening in your lives right now. Are you living daily with eternity in view or carelessly? Are you diligent or negligent in your conduct and character as a follower of Christ? If Christ wants to eat fruit from your life right now, will He find fruit or nothing but leaves? Think on these questions and seek the Lord in prayer. I believe your sincere response is very crucial for your Christian journey. The Word of God is never old fashioned. It is forever fresh today, tomorrow and for ever. So, as for you reading this article, this instruction is for ‘now’ not later.\nSecondly, as I looked further into the verse 12, I discovered that, the Bible said, ‘…He was hungry.’ Even the Messiah was hungry. He was physically hungry for food. How can the One through whom all things were made be hungry? This is no doubt the humanity aspect of Christ. And without a shadow of doubt, there is a deep spiritual lesson to glean from the phrase- ‘…He was hungry. But before I attempt to examine this profound phrase, let me briefly examine the nature of the fig tree.\nAs I discovered from this narrative, the fig tree grows fruit **before **the leaves open. But this particular fig tree having full leaves gave a false promise of a well mature fruit within it. This fig tree gave a deceptive, misleading representation in appearance. This to me is the central subject of this article. And it is a weighty matter to me as a Christian. And what about you reading this article?\nSo, when Jesus being hungry saw the bright green leaves, He thought that by nature the fruits would have matured. But as He drew closer, Jesus found ‘NOTHING BUT LEAVES’. Jesus saw a bunch of misleading and deceptive leaves with no fruits inside. He saw nothing to satisfy His hunger; nothing to energise Him; nothing to nourish and strengthen His weak body; nothing to positively impact the Kingdom; nothing to nourish and nurture the soul of men for eternity. He saw no one to commit Himself to. Then, He did something strange – something the present generation will regard as being not religiously correct and too harsh – something they will regard as being blasphemous and overzealous. What today’s young person will say, ‘that’s deep man! He cursed the fig tree forever! He placed an everlasting curse on the fig tree! This is weighty matter to me.\nFriends, let me have you know that, the spiritual truth in this article is beyond an ordinary cursed fig tree! Let me also have you know that Jesus is actually hungry for genuine souls to do exploit for the Kingdom. What the Holy Spirit is revealing to me is deep. The application is actually in relation to a productive and transforming Christian life. You have to brace up yourself to see beyond the fig trees. This is the Holy Spirit using His words to explain spiritual truth to you. And here are the spiritual truths to glean from this event in this Bible passage.\n This fig tree like many Christians today gave a false and deceptive appearance. It gave a pretentious misrepresentation of its true nature. The Bible says, “You shall know them by their fruits…” Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? I say ‘No.’ Therefore, it is fitting to note that many professing Christians live false and double standard lives. They have a gentle, pious appearance with religious language when in the public, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. They give a false impression of their true nature. They exaggerate their own self-worth. And so, when Jesus cursed the fig tree, He was simply instructing His disciples (and that includes you), that such will be the judgment of any professing Christian who is living a false and pretentious life. O, child of God, what is your story? What is your condition? Are you like this fig tree? Does your life and appearance give a false impression? Take heed, for there is a Day of Judgment – a day of reckoning. The trumpet may sound today. Amend your ways quickly before the Day comes.   Again, Jesus was teaching us that you will know a false preacher or a false prophet by what proceed out of his mouth (i.e. Leaves-empty words, high sounding nonsense). The leaves represent outward attractions, show or ostentations. It represents shallow, weak Christian life. While the fruits refer to strong godly character and conduct. Fruit also refers to a man’s inner life \u0026#8211; his thoughts, intents and nature. Jesus words here are powerful warning to the Church today and to you as well. So, as no man can see the content and the intent of the heart but only God, Jesus is teaching us here the signs to identify true Christians; ‘’You will know them by their fruits and not by their leaves’’. And this of course raises a further question \u0026#8211; what are leaves and what are fruits?   Let us see the answer to this in Luke 6:43-45 (NIV);\nNo good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.** _Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thorn bushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of._**\n1.1 What then are leaves in this context?  Leaves are not fit for eating.   Leaves are external like gifts, talents etc.   Leaves are attractions or entertainments; such that hucksters or peddlers of the Gospel (for example false teachers/false prophets and crafty men) with sweet-tongues employ to delude men.   Leaves are modern technology that cannot heal a sick soul. They have good ambience, but are destructive heresies. They are very dangerous to the soul.   They are church activities without unction. They are church promos instead of prayers.   Leaves are perishables meant for goats and cows.   Leaves also mean speaking many words with no power to convert souls.   1.2 What then are Fruits in this context?  Fruits are internal. They are of a pure heart and good conscience.   A fruit nourishes and nurtures the body.   Fruits have seed with fruit bearing capabilities.   Fruits can be likened to godliness, righteousness, meekness, joy, love, patience etc.   Fruits are edibles meant for human beings. They impact lives.   Fruits show that our words must be congruent with our lifestyles and the true teachings of Christ and the Scripture.   Fruits mean speaking much, but in few words, to convert the souls of men.   Fruits are passion instead of fashion. Life changing and destiny transforming.   The next lesson to glean from this short passage is that even though the Master is hungry for souls, He will not settle for less. He will not settle for leaves. He will not settle for lives that have not been properly cooked and baked. He will not use vessels who have not been correctly discipled. Yes, the Master desire to eat from our lives and drink from the cup in our hands, nevertheless, He will not compromise a life that has not been to the quarry, He will not use an undone, unfit and untrained vessel. The Lord desire that men are properly discipled, trimmed and tried for Kingdom purpose before being used. Herein lies the cruciality and criticality of ‘Discipleship’ as the centrality of raising faithful agents of transformation for this end time revival.   There is a passage in 1Kings 6:7 (NIV), to explain this;\n“In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built”.\nBeloved, let me have you know that when Jesus cursed the fig tree, He was not being arbitrary but deliberate. He was teaching His disciples what awaits any professing Christians who fails to do the Will of the Father. So, even in the construction of the temple, only blocks dressed (trimmed and prefinished) at the quarry were used. This to me is very instructive, in that, if in the building of stones for the temple, the workmen thought it appropriate to use pre-finish stones at the quarry before bringing them into the temple as a principle, then it is highly crucial for a professing Christian to enrol at the quarry-site for personal discipling process. It is at the quarry all unfit and unwanted materials are evacuated. It is at the quarry that God empties every dead weight and sin that easily beset or trips us up. Things such as cultural wisdom, superstitions, poor doctrine, ‘our’ church tradition, pride etc. A true professing Christian cannot escape the quarry of spiritual discipline and training. It is at this God’s quarry site (personal discipleship training school) that the inner life of a professing Christian is purged, emptied and renewed in the knowledge of Christ. It is at the quarry that correct men and women are made for the temple (God).\nTherefore, it is proper to mention that, this great omission is the bane of the Church today. Do you wonder why there is so much noise, grumbling, complaints, tradition, rebellion, distractions, high-sounding nonsense and activities inside the Church of God in our generation? The sisters are crying for the true Gospel; the young persons have become spiritual orphans; the brothers have lost direction and purpose. WHY? Because strange instruments, ungodly principles, worldly packaged marketing tools are dangerously being applied to deal with the famished souls in the temple (Church).\nBut O, Child of God, let me have you know that the WORD of GOD is the only comprehensive instrument to transform souls of men. No matter how lofty and high sounding; no matter how presentable the ambience of the church; no matter how attractive the church activities may be – they are colossal wastes without the consistent, cumulative and concerted teaching of the True Gospel. To attempt to duck and dive this Kingdom Gospel, you will be producing nothing but leaves and you will become as sounding brass or a mere tinkling cymbal! The only answer to the Church problem is the Message of the Cross-The Mystery of the Gospel. This is what Jesus was teaching us in this story of the ‘Fig Tree.’ God has His 7,000 who have not bowed down to Baal and his leaves; but souls who have fruits and are fruitful. Genuine souls who truly appreciate Christ hunger for fruits in their lives. Are you one? Are you available and willing?\nThis is very serious matter; hence you must desire the enduring power of God’s Word, and the inward renewing of your inner man which is able to deliver you to the uttermost.\n The next gleaning in this encounter with the fig tree teaches us that the leaves represent membership. But the figs (fruits) that Jesus was actually looking for was fruits-representing Followership. Friends, as good as membership is to a church in terms of statistics, organisation etc., you must not settle only for this. You must consciously take deliberate effort to seek personal communion with the Lord. Seek out for a personal functional intimate relationship with God. Christ actually desires followership and not membership! Luke 9:23 says, “Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves (himself) and take up their (his) cross daily and follow me” (NIV).  From this short but instructive verse quoted above, it is absolutely clear that what Jesus desire is actually ‘Followership’. The act of following Christ must be a deliberate, conscious, persistent and personal free will. Please note that I am not against membership of a local Church. For clarity, I am a member of a local church as well. But in seeking membership, wisdom is principal to seek ‘followership’ of Christ Jesus. Jesus Himself said, ‘… And follow me’. Friend, are you seeking membership or followership? When you seek to follow Christ, you will see His foot prints and in them plant your feet and follow Him duly. When you seek to follow Christ, you will truly appreciate why He is hungry for your spiritual growth and development. You will also hate sin and sinful habits. You will become fruitful even from a distance. It is my prayer that the Lord will make you a ‘follower’ who follow Christ and not men. And may God make you a ‘followable’ vessel that men follow in order to follow Christ in Jesus name. Amen.\nIn summary, let us look at just three scriptures to help us in our conclusion; Isa. 37:31; John 15:1-5; (ASV) Rom. 12:1-2. (GW).\n Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above. (Isa. 37:31)\nI am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that they may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing (John 15:1-5)\nBrothers and sisters, in view of all we have just shared about God’s compassion, I encourage you to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, dedicated to God and pleasing to him. This kind of worship is appropriate for you. Don’t become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants–what is good, pleasing, and perfect. (Rom. 12:1-2)\nBeloved, for want of space in this article, I will only state the essentials for our conclusion. These essential points are based on the texts shown above. Please note that anyone who desires to know God must patiently devote time to God. In our quest to know Him, we must not count any time wasted – which is spent in the cultivation of intimate fellowship with God. We must give ourselves to meditation and reflection with persistent prayer and supplication hours on end. And as touching the cursed fig tree, Jesus is saying that there are no short cut exists. God cannot bow to our jet pack lifestyle and a microwave age. He cannot bow to our hush and dash pattern. No man plants a seed in the morning and thinks it will grow and become a fruit the same day. No, but every seed must patiently take root downwards, and gradually bear fruit upward, in its due time and season and after its own kind. And the result of this patient will be fruitfulness and righteousness.\n1.3 The Way Out Here are the essential facts for our conclusion:\n You must know and accept God and His Son-Jesus Christ. You must believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead. Beloved, take it or leave it, you are simply a branch nothing more, nothing less. As long as you accept that you are a branch, you must simply remain in The Vine. Not on The Vine or around The Vine or even near, but must remain in The Vine. Friend, also note that The Vine is not just a mere tree, but a personality! For the sake of description, it is referred to as ‘The Vine.’ Actually, The Vine is Jesus Christ. The followers are the Branches. The only person who is capable and acceptable to prune you is Jesus. The reason is that you may bear more fruit (even richer and finer fruit), and not leaves. The word ‘prune’ in this verse indicates a life-long process of becoming like Jesus called Discipleship. The only comprehensive instrument by which men can be changed from ‘leaves’ into ‘fruits’ is the Word of God. To ‘abide in me’ (inside Jesus) means to remain; to dwell deeply; to stay closer; to continue as His disciple; to withstand or endure without struggling, fighting or grumbling; to await the second and glorious coming of the Lord; to accept the spiritual discipline from the correct human handler without complaint or question; and finally to pay the price or penalty of; or suffer for being a follower (Disciple) of Christ – The Vine. You can only bear fruit when (and not if) you remain in Christ and Christ remain in you. The lesson from the fig tree is that for us to bear fruit and be fruitful (producing evidence of our faith in Christ), we must dwell inside Christ. However, note that death to self is the principle of life. No branch can bear fruit by itself without remaining in The Vine. So, for you to be fruitful, it simply means that you MUST remain in Christ. And not in letters, not in books, not in tradition, church doctrine or politics. Friend, to abide means death; and for Christ to abide in you, it means eternal life. As for the fig tree, it could not remain in Christ (it could not wait for the due season of fruitfulness before giving out fruits), but instead gave out leaves out of season; hence Jesus cursed (judged) it because it was deceptive and misleading. The lesson here is that it is only in Christ that you can live a godly, righteous and sober life. The meaning of ‘cursed’ indicate; cut-off, cast away from vital union with Christ. This is why Jesus cursed the fig tree. It is very crucial to bear in mind that you cannot function independent of The Vine. No one has a root of its own. And no branch can grow or bear fruit on its own without abiding in The Vine. The crux of the matter being addressed here is SELF. This is the seat of the problem of mankind. We live in an age of self-will, self-confidence, self-love. It is rather sad that majority of professing Christians are self-deluded. They have very strong will, such that they don’t see the need of a Saviour yet they profess that they are saved. But, the reality is that such people are already cut-off from the heart beat of personal intimate relationship with Christ. No wonder many so called disciples have become drained and dried of divine flow of Christ life. But this ought not to be so. For without Christ, none of us can do anything. Hence, this fig tree had only leaves but no fruits.  Friends, if you do not want to be cut-off like this fig tree, remain in Christ! If you do not want to be thrown out like a broken branch, which withers and dies; gathered and dumped into the fire for burning, then ABIDE IN THE VINE – CHRIST.\n1.4 HOW TO ABIDE IN THE VINE – how to remain fruitful. Beloved, to explain this I shall briefly consider Rom. 12:1-2. Here also, I will only list out the critical issues to guide the gleanings.\n In view of our discussion so far, the first response is for you to appreciate the mercies of God by voluntarily dedicating (set apart) your whole bodies as a living, willing and holy sacrifice well pleasing unto God, which is your rational and proper act of worship. Secondly, you must determine in your mind (make a personal decision) that you will no longer be conformed to this world’s superficial customs and values. You must decide to reject the world’s fashion, culture, tradition, music, language and entertainment. They are cosmetic and artificial. Thirdly, deliberately yield yourself to be transformed and progressively changed as you grow spiritually by carefully renewing of the way you think. You do this by actively reading, meditating and observing to do (respond to) everything that the Word of God says. You must grow daily living by acceptable Christian values and godly attitudes. You must NOT allow the world system to drag you down to its despicable level of mediocrity and immaturity. Fourthly, then by this practical obedience to Godly instructions and corrections you prove (establish) for yourself what the Will of God is; and that it is good, and acceptable, and perfect plan and purpose for you. Finally, let Christ through His Spirit be the one at work in you, both to will and to do (respond) according to His own good pleasure. It is by this you can bear fruit and be fruitful.  1.5 PRAYERS:  Jesus is hungry for fruit. Therefore, pray that the Holy Spirit should give you a plain and simple understanding of His hunger for fruits in your own life. You need a deep revelation of what this means personally to you in Jesus name.   The Scripture says that, seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came to it perhaps He could find fruit thereon…But nothing except leaves. Friend, ask the Lord to allow your own life to be fruitful even at a distance. Pray that your character will be congruent with the Word of God. And that your life will not cast a shadow of doubt to the heart of your family, friends, children, neighbour and colleagues in Jesus name.\u0026nbsp;   Like many, the process of plucking fruit from a tree is a difficult one. It is therefore not painless. Ask the Lord that your life will not be difficult for Christ to eat from. Pray that the Cross should uproot everything that is stubborn, rebellious and self-independent in your life, so that you can remain in an unbroken union with Christ Jesus.   Pray that nothing in your life will kill fruits and fruitfulness in the Body of Christ and in the Kingdom of God in Jesus name.   Plead with God to give you grace to personally hate sin that kills fruit of revival in the Church of God in Jesus name.   Beloved, ask God to give you a clear sense of appreciation of His hunger for fruit and fruitfulness in your life, family and the Church in Jesus name.   Friend, also pray that the Lord should make you effective and efficient vessel both for life and godliness in Jesus name. Pray that you will not fail God and the Kingdom of God. Let there be no barrenness and still birth in your life and family in Jesus name.   And finally pray that the same Cross that saves, slays you (MR SELF) so that, men may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. Amen   GOD BLESS YOU.\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

May grace and truth help you to walk from day to day in the footprints of our Savior JESUS. Amen.”\n“All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Mt 11:27 (NIV) John 1:18 (ESV).****\nAs I read the above verse severally, it became very profound to me, of the infinite, immeasurable and boundless union between the Father and the Son. And for this article, allow me to share few gleanings from this verse with you. That is, the priceless companionship between the Father and the Son-Jesus Christ.\nPermit me to let you know that this verse stems out of JESUS’ prayer for the nations (people), who have not repented from their sins, even though He had performed so many miracles. It is certainly a true saying that even miracles do not make a saint, and there is a great lesson for us here. A strong lesson that is very instructive for our daily walk with GOD in this blog.\nWhen JESUS had finished given out instructions to His disciples, He went out to teach and preach through the villages and towns. On getting to this region, the LORD and Saviour performed miracles that confirmed Him as the Messiah and demanded repentance from sins and dead works (verse 20); but never-the-less they were unrepentant. They rejected the Messiah, and this would result in terrible judgment because the evidence of JESUS identity was clear. Permit me at this junction my friend to ask – Is JESUS identity and truth very clear to you? Or is it vague? Is your vision about the crucified and glorified CHRIST still blurred or obscured? This is what happened when you seek after miracles instead of intimate companionship with the Messiah. Miracle blinds the vision; it distorts the truth.\nAs I have discovered, there is a great danger when men seek only miracles without the Gospel. There is a huge consequence in the pew when the minister focuses on miracles and avoid the message of true repentance. It is like walking blindfolded; it adds salt to injury; it is also like applying bandage on a cancerous wound. Beloved, note that JESUS only did many miracles as a bait, in order to bring them to the knowledge of the truth; so that they do not perish in their sins, but to come to the place of genuine repentance. The problem of mankind is sin and not miracles; and the only comprehensive instrument to deal with the sinful nature is the Cross. The message of the Cross therefore is the Power of GOD unto salvation to everyone that believes; but foolishness to those who are perishing. JESUS is saying here that He does not want them to perish any longer in their sin. No wonder He prayed from verse 25-26.\nAt that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.\nFriend, is this your case? Has God hidden His word from you? If so, then, you must take heed and stop looking out for miracles but seek after the message of true repentance. Don’t be a follower of miracle but be a follower of Christ. ****\nMark 16:17 (KJV) says, “And these signs (miracles, wonders) shall follow them that believe…” It is very clear from this verse, that miracles come after the Good News has been preached. It does not make a saint. Genuine miracle seeks after genuine believers. It looks for them as a mother looks after her suckling child. Our GOD is the GOD of Providence. Because it is the Kingdom right of believers that miracles should look for them, and not them looking after miracles. You see it looks very similar, but there is a huge difference.\nSo, it was on this premise that JESUS prayed to the Father on behalf of the remnants. This prayer focuses on the remnant at that time, and even in the present generation that despite the popular overall rejection of the Message of the Cross. There are still remnants who faithfully embrace the truth, follow Jesus and not miracles.****\nIndeed, without controversy or argument the Father knows his Son. The Son equally knows his Father. The ‘Son’ being referred to in this verse is quite distinct; even the ‘Father’ is in caps as well. In my KJV, NLT and NIV translations, it is also with capital letter. And without controversy, the ‘Son’ is no other person, but CHRIST and the ‘Father’ is GOD. The tone of this statement is as if JESUS was making reference to a third person that He knew. To aptly put it, a COMPANION. However, He was actually making reference to Himself. CHRIST is the Only Begotten Son of GOD. This is very instructive for us.\nAs I continued my gleanings, I discovered that, there is an intimacy of oneness between the Father and the Son. There is a bond of love and peace between the Father and the Son. Love so deep and vast beyond all measure. Such that the Father could not commit the revelation of himself to anyone else, except His Son – JESUS CHRIST.\nThe implication of this to me is that, even though God is Omni-present, yet He only reveals himself through His Son to whom He chooses. He reveals himself only to those who diligently seek Him. He reveals Himself to those who are His companion in a deep intimacy with His Own Son. He reveals it to those who worship Him in spirit and in truth. To those who carry his DNA. And I am glad to announce that GOD has shed this love in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of love which every genuine believer receives at conversion. The question in my mind is, “Is this love in your heart? Is this love of CHRIST in the Church today? In the family? Would CHRIST, the Love of GOD finds His Spirit of love in our hearts to commit divine task into our hands when He returns?” Remember John 2:24?\n_“_But Jesus, for His part, did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all people [and understood the superficiality and fickleness of human nature]”. (AMP) __\n Oh, how I fervently pray that the Lord will stamp skin deep in our hearts His unutterable love in Jesus name. For no human nature (Mr. Flesh) can glory in His presence.\nAs I continue in my gleaning, I discovered that the Father and the Son have fellowship with each other. An uncommon communion that has developed into a strong inseparable and unbroken companionship between them. And no one can separate them. A relationship that is everlasting and perfect. Such that the Father has confidence in the Son to the extent of committing all things to Him. I mean GOD the Father delivered all things into the hands of JESUS! Please, tell me which earthly king or queen can honestly do that and would not withhold few rights and privileges from the son? But we see GOD willingly put all things into the hand of His Son – who being the brightness of His glory, an express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, after He had by Himself found Him worthy, faithful, obedient and holy. Being made so much better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than them; to the extent that the Son gave up His own will for the Father’s will to be done. (Heb.1:3-4).\nBeloved, I just wonder if God can find us faithful to commit souls of men into our hands; to commit His kingdom projects; to commit young virgins, young men, elderly into our hands? What would our relationship with them bring forth? Controversy or condemnation? Will their lives produce fruits meet for repentance and Master’s use? Will they come out of our hands with testimony of His grace and mercy? Would we defile, abuse or damage them? Will they become better or battered? Will they be transformed from the bondage of self, sin and Satan into the Kingdom of light of our LORD JESUS? O, for Thy grace LORD, for a sustainable and dependable intimate companionship with You every day, every hour in Jesus name.\nLooking closely at the second phrase from that verse 17 which says “… And nobody knows the Son except the Father.” It is pertinent to note the word ‘nobody.’ It means no one – no matter how highly placed; intelligent; connected; influential; wealthy; famous; whether a celebrity or not; be it the poor; the needy; whether you are a professional theologian; whether a pontiff; whether a prayer warrior; you cannot have knowledge of JESUS except by the Father. This is a strong and profound statement, “… And nobody knows the Son except the Father.“\nJESUS is saying that the Father is not partial and is no respecter of anybody. This, to me, is weighty and deep. It gives me much confidence and assurance that it is not by works but by grace. It is not by status or class that anyone can know the Son and the Father, but through the mercy and love of GOD. Hallelujah!\nTherefore, let it be known to you that except the Son chooses, nobody can claim to know the Father. In addition, no man of GOD born of a woman, no angel or spirit can reveal either the Father or his Son, except either of them chooses, wills, decides to give any revelation. It means that you cannot induce, cajole, deceive them. You cannot even compel or force them. It also means that you cannot steal the word from them. But for any genuine revelation, it can only be by their own prerogative – the choice ofboth the Father and the Son. And as companions, nothing is hidden between them. This is the Mystery of the Gospel; that CHRIST JESUS is the Son of God who came into this world of sin in the human flesh from heaven to express the love of the Father to all. He did this by giving his life as a living sacrifice on the Cross to save mankind from sin – (John 12:23-27). This has been revealed to us by the ministry of the prophets in the Old testament, by the ministry of JESUS in person and the ministry of the apostles by the Holy Spirit. So my friend, let me ask you this crucial question – do you have a personal revelation of the crucified and glorified CHRIST? Have you personally encountered the divine power of GOD that has given us everything that we need both for life and godliness through the knowledge of CHRIST? Have you seen the Cross and Him crucified and Him glorified? Can you faithfully point to a definite encounter of your assurance of salvation? If not, then you need to be saved. Don’t delay. Take that lifetime decision NOW!\nFinally, it is instructive to note here that, you must humble yourself in the presence of the LORD, before the Son can reveal the Father to you. A proud and arrogant man can neither know GOD nor JESUS. The man who has lifted up his soul to sin and self cannot know GOD. GOD is very far away from such self-induced person. For example, when JESUS asked the disciples, “What do men say that I the Son of Man is?” Simon Peter answered and said, ‘Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.’ But Jesus answered, ‘Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona; for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which art in heaven’ (Matthew 16:15-17 KJV). Truly, as sons and daughters, we must be the true likeness of the Father. But my friend, are you one? Is your lifestyle a true likeness of the kingdom? (See the Beatitudes in Matthew 5-7). Does your life release the true fragrance of the knowledge of the Son of GOD or of the flesh (Mr. Self)?\nIt took the Father to reveal the Son to Peter. Not even the Scribes, Pharisees or Disciples could know the Son, but by the Spirit of the Father to Peter. Also, it took Judas who had been with the Son of God for three and half years to mark out JESUS with an un-holy kiss before His arrest by the soldiers.\nLet me have you know that even if you decide to study the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, you cannot beat or outsmart GOD unless you surrender to His Son; acknowledge Him as Your Personal Lord and Saviour; then, ask Him to fill you with the Holy Spirit. This is a cardinal step in knowing GOD and JESUS, His only Son. “For no man can know the Father except whomsoever the Son wills to reveal Him”. Amen.\n1.2 Way Out:  Acknowledge that JESUS is the Son of GOD; and that He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. (John 14:6-7)   Recognise that GOD has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Him, JESUS. (Matt. 28:18)   Let it be known unto you that the Father loves His Son and has committed ALL things into His hands. (John 3:35).   And that when you believe in your heart, that Jesus is the Lord and Saviour, and by confession in your mouth, you shall be saved. So, be born again. (Rom. 10:9-10)   Grow daily in faith by daily reading, searching and living out the Word of GOD; for in it you have eternal life. (John 5:39)   Keep knowing this, that the Father knows the Son and the Son knows the Father; and JESUS the Son of God gave His sinless life for you as a sacrifice on the Cross. (John 10:15)   Finally, be a disciple of CHRIST. Jesus has revealed the Father to us, and will continue to do so. By this, His love will be in you daily. (John 17:25-26). This verse gives me so much joy. What about you?   1.2.1 Short Prayer: Thank You GOD, for Your Holy Word. It is so sweet and pure, such that no flesh can glory in Your presence. Because, if not for You, we cannot know CHRIST. LORD JESUS, we know that GOD uses man to reveal His word, but if You do not help us, our lives and our ways will be dark, slippery and crooked.\nLORD JESUS, honestly, we don’t want to continue living in our sins and love our own selves. Baptise us with Your Pure Spirit that we may hate iniquity, pride and disobedience. Give us grace to love You, Your Kingdom and Your righteousness. For how long would we remain a blind guide and a mute messenger, and allow ignorance and arrogance to damage and batter us? So, our blessed Saviour, be Thou forever near us; help us not to wander from the truth any more – but to follow You duly in true companionship to the end. Give us grace to follow You, our Master and our Friend. Please, strengthen our feeble minds to feel Thee and draw us nearer to Thee. There are many tempting sounds and sights that daze and dazzle us. Nevertheless, draw us nearer to the Cross and shield our soul from self and sin. Finally, Blessed Holy Spirit, thou guardian of our soul, give us a PERSONAL REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST in Jesus name we pray. Amen. (Rev. 1:1)\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. \u0026nbsp;By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Hebrews chapter 2 verse 9-14 says,\u0026nbsp;‘But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. \u0026nbsp;For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. \u0026nbsp;And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. \u0026nbsp;Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.   Hebrews chapter\u0026nbsp;9\u0026nbsp;verses 11-15\u0026nbsp;says:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; \u0026nbsp;Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. \u0026nbsp;For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? \u0026nbsp;And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.   2 Corinthians chapter\u0026nbsp;5\u0026nbsp;verse\u0026nbsp;21\u0026nbsp;says:\u0026nbsp;For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.   Galatians chapter 5 verse 24\u0026nbsp;says:\u0026nbsp;And they that are Christ\u0026#8217;s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.   Isaiah chapter 53\u0026nbsp;verse\u0026nbsp;5-6\u0026nbsp;says:\u0026nbsp;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed \u0026nbsp;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the\u0026nbsp;Lord\u0026nbsp;hath laid on him the iniquity of us all   1.1 Things to know Galatians chapter 3 verse 13-14 says: “****Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”), that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith”. (NKJV).\nThis is the second Scripture we shall examine to verify if actually Christ has dealt permanently with the flesh. It is my prayer that the Holy Spirit will illuminate your hearts to the completed work of our redemption. This must be settled in your mind as we continue in this study of the Mystery of the Gospel. It must be a personal revelation with a heart that is sincere before God.\nJohn chapter 9 verse 34-38 says: They answered and said unto him, thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. (KJV)\nTo attempt this discussion let us first define “what is the curse of the law”? According to** Galatians chapter 3 verses 10-11 says:** _For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. (KJV)_\nWhat we must understand here is that the curse is not the Law. But the punishment or penalty imposed on breaking the Law. The Book of the Law means the covenant laws that God gave to Moses in the Old Testament.\nAs good as the Law is, you cannot make yourself right with God by keeping a set of laws. To attempt to do such is to cut off from Christ. It means you have fallen from grace to disgrace. Rather, you must live by the Spirit of God through faith in the righteousness that God has promised us. You must place your faith in Christ Jesus. The main reason for the Law is two-fold; to point out our sins to us and to sign post us to the Saviour-Jesus Christ.\nThere were over 700 laws that the Jews were to keep and must not break anyone. However, where a person believes he can live by the Law now breaks it, he is under condemnation of the Law, i.e. Punishment. It is this punishment or penalty that is called the curse of the Law. Let us know that no man can achieve Salvation through strict observance of the Law. If it were so, then Christ came and died in vain. Then, it means our righteousness is of the Law and not of the promise by Faith. But the good news (The Mystery of the Gospel) is that Jesus Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming the curse of the Law for mankind on the tree at Calvary (we shall study this in detail). (Galatians chapter 3 verse 13 says: Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: KJV\nThe curse (punishment, liability, exposure, grief, sorrow, pain, sickness etc.) He bore for us in His own body by Himself on the Cross is death. (1 Peter chapter 2 verse 24 says, who his own self bares our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (KJV)\nNo one can be made perfect through the Law. It is a complete effort in futility. For a man to attempt to do so breeds pride, and the end of pride is a curse called destruction. So, it is through our faith in Christ Jesus death, burial and resurrection according to the scriptures that we are saved from the curse of the Law (flesh).\n(Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8-10 says, for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\nKJV,).\nFurther Texts:\n“whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His Forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus”. (Romans chapter 3 verses 25-26) NKJV\nThe curse of the Law fell on Jesus Christ who was the perfect sacrifice, acceptable substitute. So that, through His obedience unto death, we might become the righteousness of God**. **This is what Christ took upon Himself for mankind in order to save us from eternal death and sin.\n1.2 Things to know Scriptural Examples of traditional/religious opposition to Jesus power heal and to forgive sins\na) Jews and the Sabbath: –**** John 5-chapter verse 1-16 says: After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, wilt thou be made whole? The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, it is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, take up thy bed, and walk. Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed, and walk. And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. And therefore, did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. (KJV)\nb) Opposition from religious leaders****. John chapter 9 verses 1-5 says: And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\nJohn chapter 9 verse 8-12 say:  The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, this is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. Therefore, said they unto him, how were thine eyes opened? He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. Then said they unto him, where is he? He said, I know not.\nJohn chapter 9 verse 13-18 says: They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. Then again, the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. Therefore, said some of the Pharisees, this man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. They say unto the blind man again, what sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.\nJohn chapter 9 verse 19-38 says: And they asked them, saying, is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now sees? His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore, said his parents, He is of age; ask him. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. He answered and said, whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. Then said they to him again, what did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? Then they reviled him, and said, thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. The man answered and said unto them, why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. (KJV).\n Study the texts above and discuss its implication today in your church, fellowship, and the community.   Share your personal experience with us.

Romans\u0026nbsp;chapter\u0026nbsp;8\u0026nbsp;verse\u0026nbsp;3\u0026nbsp;says,\u0026nbsp;for what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending\u0026nbsp;His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:\u0026nbsp;(NKJV, KJV)   Galatians chapter\u0026nbsp;3\u0026nbsp;verse\u0026nbsp;13-14\u0026nbsp;says,\u0026nbsp;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: \u0026nbsp;That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\u0026nbsp;(NKJV, KJV)   Having briefly highlighted the meaning, nature and few activities of the flesh, it is therefore very important to establish whether Jesus who came in the flesh has completely freed us from the power of the flesh. The Power of the flesh is in its ability to dictate to us what it wants us to do at will. It is the power that controls our senses, sights and reasoning. It is the power that makes us do what we do. It is the power that arouses in us the strength and desires that produces a harvest of sinful deeds that leads to death.\nPlease note: That sin as a principle, deploys its alluring potent power on the flesh to lure man to sin against God and His Word. So, it is important to establish at this point that, the actual power of sin is not in sin, but in its ability to ISOLATE AND TERMINATE a believer from the presence of the Lord. (study the whole of Genesis chapter 3 for further understanding)\nNow, let us closely examine if Jesus has freed us from the power flesh, its activities and its control? Below are few texts to help our understanding.\n1. Romans chapter 8 verse 3 says: “For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His Own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh,” (NKJV).\nAs I discovered from this text, let us note that in an unregenerate man nothing good dwells in the flesh. The flesh is of death (Romans chapter 7 verse 1-24 KJV) hence no man can be justified by the law or keeping any human standards through the flesh (Galatians chapter 3 verse 11 says: But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.\nRomans chapter 3 verse 20 says: Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.__ KJV\n1.2 Things to Know: Let it be clear that the Law can do all things. The Law here is the Truth; it is also holy; It is the Word of God. It is life-giving. t is not a letter. For the letter killeth but the Spirit giveth life. 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 6\nIt is not the law that was weak,but was rendered weak ‘THROUGH’ the flesh. Hence, the law could not do anything. The fact is that, the Flesh by nature is intrinsically rebellious and stubborn. As briefly mentioned above. And so, makes the law- (though holy and righteous) weak. Please discuss the preposition ‘through’ in this verse and its implication on your own walk with God.\n So, to a carnal man, the law of God is just a mere letter. And to such a carnal man, it lacks power and purpose to make him to obey the Will of God or receive divine supply of grace to meet divine demands of God. It is, therefore, as a result of the above that the law, appears seemingly incapable of pleasing God because of man attempt to keep the Law. It is man’s fault and NOT God! The flesh is of sin, yet Jesus became flesh. Nevertheless, Jesus was only in the ‘**likeness’ **of the flesh and did not have the sinful nature of the flesh. **(2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 says: **For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.  Hebrews chapter 4 verse 15 says: For we have not a High priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin. KJV, LB).\n See it in the context of the bronze serpent as the form or likeness of the actual living serpent biting the people of God. ( Deuteronomy chapter 21 verse 18 -23 says : If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he dies: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.  1.3 Things to know a.) So how did Jesus become a sin for mankind? Because Christ drank the cup of our iniquity\n2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 says: For God took the sinless Christ and poured into him our sins. Then, in exchange, he poured God’s goodness into us! Living Bible\nIsaiah chapter 53 verse 4-6 says: Surely, he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\nLuke**** chapter 22 verse 42 says: Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done. (****KJV), He became an embodiment of sin and was crucified in the flesh\nColossians chapter 1 verse 22 says: In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:\n1 Peter chapter 3 verse 18 says: For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:\nRomans chapter 6 verses 6-7 says: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. (KJV)\nPlease discuss the implication of these texts in your group. Do you now believe that you have been delivered from the power and tyranny of sin and Satan? Or you still live in doubt of the reality of the completed work of Calvar****y?).\nThus, on the Cross Jesus judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, thereby destroying Satan (Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 says: Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; (KJV)\nColossians chapter 2 verse 13-15 ****says: And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.\n At the same time, God condemned sin through the death of Christ in the flesh which was brought by Satan into man’s flesh. Hence, it is possible for us to walk daily in this body not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit by the help of the Holy Spirit.   From the text in Romans\u0026nbsp;chapter\u0026nbsp;8\u0026nbsp;verse\u0026nbsp;3\u0026nbsp;which says:\u0026nbsp;For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.

(Hebrews 2: 16-18 KJV).\n1.3 WHY IS THIS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME?  Christ was tempted like every mankind but He did not yield to the temptation. A person who sins does not suffer when he is tempted, such a person chooses to sin and then suffers for the sin committed. (Job chapter 36 verse 21). Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction KJV. But as for Christ, He suffered when He was tempted because He chose OBEDIENCE instead. He resisted the lust and temptation through obedience to God. Are you willing to do the same now? Again, each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lusts and enticed. (James chapter 1 verse 14 says: But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. KJV). So, if Christ did not have the same flesh as man, then He could not have been able to save us through His death from our sins. I discovered also, that He needed to take up the nature of Man (Seed of Abraham) so that in all things He will be accepted as a perfect sacrifice to meet the just demand of God. For it was not angels or animals that sinned but the seed of Abraham (of whom I am one). Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; (Romans chapter 1 verse 3 KJV) In addition, if He did not have flesh and blood like ours, how could He have been a High Priest who is merciful and kind in things pertaining to God? And make propitiation for our sins? Thank God for His wisdom. To deny that Jesus came in the flesh is to nullify the Cross and His death. (Philippians chapter 3 verse 10, says, That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death. (KJV) Philippians chapter 3 verse 18 says, (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Again, I noted the phrase ‘in all things’… This is very important for our learning that when the Bible says ‘all things’ it means all, all is all. It neither means few things nor some things but ‘all things. And what do we mean by ‘in all things’? it means in negative purposes whether it is a period of suffering, weakness, need, lack, pain, affliction, persecution, hatred, death, sorrow, grief etc, he felt what we now feel. He had the same experience, even much severe and difficult experience-death by hanging on the Cross! And in positive purposes, as regarding Him being our merciful and faithful High Priest who has the human nature, that He may sympathize with us ‘in all things’  1.3.1 GROUP DISCUSSION  Discuss among yourselves the implications of the phrase ‘like His brethren’ and ‘to make propitiation’ for the sins of the people. What do you understand by this? Describe how Jesus as High Priest was able to succor the people. In what way has He provided help for His brethren? Even for you?  1.4 WHAT THEN IS ‘’THE FLESH’’? (Galatians chapter 5 verses 15-17 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. (KJV)\nGalatians chapter 5 verses 19-21 says: Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\nThe flesh is the will of a man, that does what is contrary to the Will of God. It has it operation sourced from what is called the Adamic nature, sinful nature is known as the old man. This is the nature we all born of a woman inherited at our natural birth from Adam, It’s activities and its works can be seen in the aforementioned scripture above in Galatians chapter 5 verses 19-21 called the sin-location.\nAnd before we continue, let us examine briefly what then is the power of the flesh that kept us in bondage for ages before Jesus had to come in the human flesh to save us from? How did we come under this tyranny of sin? Why do I behave the WAY I DO?\nIn the Scripture, we have several references to the word ‘flesh’. It connotes a different meaning. It simply means the physical body. But however, when the word flesh comes with a definite article, ‘the’ it actually refers to what we are about to briefly look into. And this is important for our study.\nWhenever the prefix ‘the’ is used with the word flesh, it clearly refers to that aspect of mankind that is estranged from God. It is everything that opposes God, the Word of God, and the Spirit of God. The flesh refers to every aspect of the evil forces that control the air-kingdoms, principalities, etc. The flesh also refers to the body corrupted and ruined by sin. It is the Adamic sinful nature. It always rejects the law of God. It is that part of me when I want to do what is right but I find myself doing the opposite. It is the life within me that is at war with my mind and my members.\nIt is the rebellious, stubborn, unruly, and incorrigible part of man. It is the legal ground for sin, Satan, the world system, etc. It is the root of selfishness, self-confidence, the quarrel between parties, robbery, war, destruction, divorce, murder, slander, orgies, witchcraft, infidelity, demonic activities, etc. It does not accept simple correction; it seeks its own way and will. It weakens our reasoning. It impairs our tender conscience. It obscures or darkens our God’s sense and perspective. It gives us a defective view of Christ and the Word of God. It is completely anti-Gospel. It thrives in the cover-up (fig-leaves), blames game, and excuses. It distracts us away from whatever is spiritual and brings us into the carnal and natural. It creates enmity between us and God. It loves to dominate, intimidate, and manipulate people, circumstances, etc. It is the fallen nature (lower nature) of man. It always wants to be in control and have authority. It is the root of pride, love for money, and material things. It has many aliases namely; Mr. Flesh, The Carnal nature, The Sinful nature, Adamic nature, The Natural Man, and The Old Man to mention just a few.\nGenesis chapter 2 verse 7 says: And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\nGenesis chapter 15 verse 17 says: And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.\nGenesis chapter 3 verse 6-13 says: And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, the woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, the serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\nGenesis chapter 3 verses 21 says: Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.\nDeuteronomy chapter 21 verses 18-23 says, Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\nKJV, NKJV).\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,\n4 while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendour and pomp of his greatness for many days, 180 days.\n5 And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa, the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.\n6 There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.\n7 Drinks were served in golden vessels, vessels of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king.\n8 And the drinking was according to this edict: “There is no compulsion.” For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired.\n9 Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus.\n(NKJV)\nBeloved, as I look carefully at this beginning of the book of Esther, it is profound that it began with the phrase, “Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces; That in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa, the capital…”\nAs I began to carefully study the narrative story of Esther, there are so many issues that the Holy Spirit will be confronting us as individuals, which are needful for our daily practical Christian life. They are lessons to both learn and apply for life and godliness. And God will be revealing the secret of His kingdom to us through the knowledge of Him by the Holy Spirit. So, let us begin our study.\nIt is very interesting to note that the opening verse of this book of Esther began with ‘Now…’ But it is however referring to past days of King Ahasuerus which is seemingly strange. However, as I pressed further with the Holy Spirit to shed more light on this, it became clear to me that even though the story is past; even though the Scripture has been written thousands of years past; it is still present (real-time) and applicable for me today. The truth is that history will always repeat itself, but many have not learned from it. So, the LORD is bringing it again. This to me is instructive for my learning and daily application.\nAnd on this premise, it is very crucial to briefly consider the days of this pagan king, while he was on the throne in his royal kingdom. Because, if truly I am a new creature and old things have passed away, then all things must become new; including the life within me. So, what I have learned is that my life is only a container or throne upon which the King of Kings must dwell in and reign. Even so, even as King Ahasuerus’ reign was limited by time life, equally we are limited as well by death. But Christ, the King of Kings, is no more limited by death and time, for He is risen and forever liveth. Hence, Christ desires to indwell your life as the King of Kings.\nTherefore, necessity behooves that today (during our lifetime), we can and must only live for Jesus. But the big question before us is still the matter of, “What are you presently doing in your times like this (before the return of the coming King?” King Ahasuerus is no more, but we are still living. But what are you living for and unto in times like this?\nNow, for understanding purpose, let us say that King Ahasuerus reigned for 30years, and there are 365days in a year, it means that he ruled for 10,950 days on the throne at Susa, the capital. Besides, each day of a man, and that of a king for that matter is filled with troubles, battles, ceremonies, etc. Meaning, we cannot afford to gloss over how the king spent his days during his tenure. Also, we shall give an account of how we lived each day in this body one day? The Scripture says in 2Cor.5:10 that, “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in this body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”\nBeloved, as I read this verse, I cringe with fear. I do not know about you, but as I meditated on the phrase “…that everyone may receive the things done in this body…” my understanding of this phrase is that there is an invisible digital audio-visual recorder that keeps account of everything done in this body. Be it action, words, thoughts, and motives ever carried out in this body since I was born. Although the Bible says that my sins and iniquities He will remember no more, but what about what I have done since I became a new-creation man in presumption? What about the records of broken ordinances and promises? What have I done in this body since I became a minister of the Good News? How have I spent yesterday and today? Have I spent it on deceitfulness, worry, anxiety, or unforgiveness? If the trumpet sound now, where would my soul go to? Have I spent my days in this body serving the King of kings or serving the Old Man (Mr. Flesh)?\nDo you know that how a man spends his days in this body, will determine where he will end up when he departs from this body? So, please May I then remind you again, that our days are numbered, and we cannot afford to live unto ourselves and for ourselves, but for Him and unto Him, who loved us and gave His life for us as a ransom. It is, therefore, expedient that we live with eternity in view. We must not engage our ransomed soul with jokes, jests, and incomplete gospel. Rather, we must feed our souls with The True Gospel. For the Word of God is the comprehensive divine instrument given by God unto man to be changed inside-out.\nConsequently, as time went on, this pagan king spent his days feasting and drinking strong drinks with the nobles, princes, and the people. He even became high in spirit, under the influence of alcohol. Also, he spent his days pleasing Mr. Self – the Old man. Do you know that it’s frightening to note that king Ahasuerus spent 187 days (six months and seven days) in feasting and drinking? And without doubt, the days were filled and flooded with revelling, partying, debauchery, drunkenness, seduction, and murders. So, as I carefully look into how this pagan-king spent his days, permit me to ask, ‘Child of God’ (who has been saved not by natural succession or descent, but by grace), how will you spend the rest of your days here on earth? What if the trumpet sounds right in your sleep, before the breaking of the day? Will the LORD find you faithful in this body?\nI believe that King Ahasuerus became king by vain conversation, received by established tradition and native wisdom from his ancestors. But as for you, you have been redeemed by the precious and priceless blood of the Lamb of God, without blemish and spot. It is, therefore, expedient that you spend your days in holy fear and trembling in this body before the LORD. As a child of God, you must spend your days redeeming the time; for the days are evil. You must infuse your life into the Mystery of godliness. Let the Mystery of the Gospel be your food and nourishment. You must begin your days with the LORD in intimate personal devotion and functional relationship. It is before the LORD that one can receive instructions and directions for each day to fulfill his/her destiny.\nThe Bible says in 2 Tim 2:15, ”Do your best to present yourself before the LORD as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing/handling the word of truth.” From this scripture, the Holy Spirit is saying to me that it is a personal responsibility to the best of my ability to ensure that “I present myself before the LORD.” God does not want things; God does not want tithes and excuses, but He needs my heart. And that the best approval is of GOD. But I must however present myself first before I can be approved unto GOD. The truth is that the best of man is man. The way I understand the word ”present” is that I have to lay down my self-life; I have to bring self into captivity to the obedience of Christ. Mr. Self must be laid at the feet of the LORD i.e. I must voluntarily, deliberately surrender my self-will at the foot of the wondrous Cross. It also means that I must willingly deny myself; daily carry my cross; before I can be approved by God to be His true follower. It is God’s approval that counts and not man. The practical lesson here is that the Old man must be completely evacuated before the New Creation Man can rightly handle the Word of God.\nKing Ahasuerus came with the Old Creation Man lifestyle inherited from his ancestors, and you cannot expect him to do otherwise. But as for the believer, the Cross has happened, and hence we cannot afford to spend our days feasting and drinking. For the kingdom of God is not for drinking and eating; but for joy, peace, and righteousness in the Holy Spirit. It is your personal responsibility to daily find out what God would have you do in this body daily. You must diligently seek to know the will of God for you each day.\nBut this demands high commitment and devotion. Even as I remember the story of the borrowed axe, which got drowned in the sea; the LORD is reminding me that I should not forget that I am living daily on borrowed life; borrowed time; borrowed breath. Hence, necessity demands that I must not let my borrowed axe fall away in the water of this life. My axe must not be drowned by the worries, urges, anxieties, and societal evils of this present world; for alas, we are borrowed vessels for the end-time revival labour. I must ask the Holy Spirit to teach and train me on how to manage the kingdom’s economy and lifestyle with godly wisdom. We must not be wasteful and prodigal in lifestyle, like this pagan king who barely into the third year of his reign, organized 187 days of feasting and drinking!\nDearly beloved, I want you to know that no sane man will do things for no reason. So, as I study further in Chapter 1 of the book of Esther, it is fitting to find out why this king organized such a marathon feasting for the nobles and princes of his kingdom? King Ahasuerus was not being arbitrary for organizing such flagrant wasteful feasting and drinking for 187 days. He had a purpose which shall be uncovered.\nLet us look into verse 4 and discover the reason for this waste. But for the benefit of context, let us read verses 3-4, “…that in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his officials and servants—the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces being before him— 4 when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendour of his excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days in all.”\nAs I look at verse three of chapter 1 of Esther, it is apparent that the reason behind this flagrant waste was ‘pride’ and ‘ostentation.’ Child of God, bear in mind that the root of the fall of Satan was pride and his audacious desire to challenge God. God hates a proud heart. It is fearful to know that pride is the root of sin. As I look at this story, I am appalled that barely three years into his tenure, this pagan king embarked on an ostentatious show of the glorious riches and splendour of his excellent majesty. This is rather a childish thing to do. I have a strong inclination that he had thought this through, and concluded that the only way he could consolidate his reign was to engage in this lavish feast. May I, therefore, draw our attention to the fact that there are practical lessons to glean from this narrative as believers.\nAt this junction, let me discuss a few godly practical lessons here. However, please permit me to state that it is imperative to know that even though God is not against our celebration, but not this type of wasteful arrangement. Even the Bible says that the kingdom of God is not for eating and drinking, but righteousness, joy, and peace in the Holy Spirit. As a householder in the vineyard of the Lord, you must be in right standing with Him. You must be a trusted steward of what God has committed to your hands. We are not to be devourers of the bread meant for men, but faithful stewards. As stewards in the house of faith, we are to give men the bread due to them in due season. But this was not so for this king. He rather abused the privilege of the treasure in his care. His action was nothing short of mismanagement of state funds and resources. A gateway to corruption and bribery.\nBut as for you, Child of God, to be a faithful steward requires wisdom and divine ability to carry out what is dutiful and entrusted to your care. It demands ownership, responsibility, accountability, and reward. However, this pagan king acted irresponsibly without question from his nobles and princes. For example, husband, do you know that your wife and children are entrusted into your hand by the Lord? Pastor, do you know that necessity lies upon you to shepherd the flock of God under you? Are you a wife and you are privileged to manage the family account, but you are mismanaging it? Are you a student, but you are not a prudent steward with your monthly allowance? The reality is that each of us will give account to the Lord about the affairs of our stewardship, however insignificant they may be. I see that the life of this pagan king is a stern warning to us today. Are you a wife reading this blog? God is saying to you that you must not keep quiet when you notice that your husband is becoming wasteful with his spending habits. You must first take the matter to God before raising it with him. And in speaking to your husband, do so in love and respect. Don’t attempt to fly off the handle and speak to him. Be certain to take it to the Lord in prayer on behalf of the family. You must not be a party to such waste. To ignore such wasteful spending will attract great consequences to the family.\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.” (NKJV)\n1.1.2 COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS:  The “how”, “when” and “whom” was\u0026nbsp;prophesied was hidden for a long time. But when the full manifestation of time came, God was manifested to all mankind through Christ Jesus. And it is in the preaching of the Gospel that Christ the Power and\u0026nbsp;Glory of God is revealed-\u0026nbsp;This is the Mystery of the Gospel. (See John\u0026nbsp;5: 1-20 and\u0026nbsp;John 9: 1-41 NKJV, KJV).   There is fullness of time and season to everything under the earth. Even to each of us when we came to Christ. We came to him when it was set by the mercy of God. Who knows whether this is your own time for deliverance?   There is no understanding of God apart from a deliberate personal intimate functional relationship with His Son- Jesus Christ.   It is ONLY through Jesus we can live and manifest a perfect life and not through any other person, means or object. Not even through our superstitions, sentiments, culture, tradition or religion.   In its complete understanding, God has revealed to mankind that, it is through Jesus Christ that we are being saved.   The absolute way to eternal life is the unshakable and unwavering faith in Christ suffering, death, burial and resurrection.\u0026nbsp;And neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u0026nbsp;Acts\u0026nbsp;chapter\u0026nbsp;4 verse\u0026nbsp;12. (KJV)   EXCEPT THE NAME OF JESUS! (We must know that Salvation comes no other way; and no other name has been or will be given to us by which we can be saved, only this one…. JESUS CHRIST!\nLet us now closely examine each of this segment of the Mystery of the Gospel. Our central Scriptural guide to this study is 1 Timothy chapter3 verse 16 “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory”.\n1.2 JESUS CAME IN THE FLESH i.} Did Jesus actually come in the flesh? To attempt this question, let us look at the account of His genealogy as reported in\nMatthew Chapter 1 verses 16-17 says: And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. So, all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.\nMatthew chapter 1 verses 18-22 says**: **_Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,_\nCf. I_saiah chapter 11 verse 1 says: _And there shall come forth a Rod out of the Stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of His roots: (NKJV, KJV).\nii.} Jesus Birth: Luke chapter 1 verses 26-35 says:And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore, also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. (KJV)\nLuke chapter 1 verse 42-45 says:**** And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. (NKJV, KJV)\nLuke chapter 2 verse 6-7 says: And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.\nLuke chapter 2 verses 16-19 says: And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.\nLuke chapter 2 verses 25-32 says:**** And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. (KJV)\nLuke chapter 2 verse 36-40 says:**** And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fasting and prayers night and day. And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him. (NKJV, KJV)\nMatthew chapter 2 verse 1-2 says: Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship Him.\nMatthew chapter 2 verse 6 says: And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.\nMatthew chapter 2 verse 11 says: And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

The Lord has pre-determined and prepared all things even before the preparation of the world. Every event in any dispensation are all preordained by the Lord. And nothing happens without His divine approval. Actually, God rules in the affairs of men.\nIn addition, as we begin our gleanings on the book of Esther, this delightful verse is telling us that there is an unseen hand moving the scene from behind by His power and might. This unseen hand has continually guided and controlled the destiny of dispensations of time where men and women have existed and still exist. The sovereign Lord is graciously and timely working out behind the scene both to will and to do all things according to his good pleasure.\nSo, the narrative in the book of Esther will reveal to you the uncompromising faithfulness and righteousness of men and women of faith who searched for God’s purpose, what He had ordained, what He had revealed even though the name of God was not mentioned at all in this book of Esther. The invisible hand of God is surely guiding and controlling the fate of generations, nations and nations of people according to His will and purpose.\nTherefore, as we progress in these gleanings of Esther, you will soon discover the blessed faithfulness and integrity of sages. Indeed, God is never very far from the thoughts of a person of faith. A faithful and righteous man or woman is one who has experienced first, a basic revelation of Christ and as he or she presses on, God in His abundant mercy progressively reveals more and more of the Mystery of Godliness unto them. This to me is the central aspect of this gleaning about person and character queen Esther and her uncle Mordecai.\nFurthermore, it is only a man or woman with an inner seeing eyes and inner hearing ears that can be a companion of God. I discovered in this narrative that the extent of man’s growth is largely hinged on His intimate knowledge and fellowship with God. May the Lord give you a seeing eyes, hearing ears and perceiving heart as you glean along in this story of queen Esther even in a foreign land.\nThe timely and active role of Mordecai in this book indicate to me that the Holy Spirit was at work to lend him sight, insight, and foresight into the history annals to passionately save the Jews. He had an unquestionable passion for his beloved people. His unconditional love for his fellow Jews led him to risk even his life before Haman in order to deliver his people from the evil decree of Haman. He certainly saw God in his situation. Such that if Esther failed to boldly risk her influential role, even deliverance will come from another source. This begs the question, what am I using my position as a believer to do in my workplace, family and community? To exploit, harass or bully? Or to glorify God and bless others? Or to legislate the light-life of the kingdom of God? These are issues and many more we will consider in this gleaning.\nFinally, we see God using mere man-a gate keeper to do great things. Man, who was nothing. Man, who was base and unpopular was used by God to penetrate the high places as it were for the deliverance of the Jews. What a might God we serve.\n‘For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence’. (1Cor.1:26-29)\nIn conclusion, the Living God in His holy character and nature does not close His holy eyes to the oppressed, poor, and needy in the society. The very true God whom we serve cannot and will not, turn His eyes away from the oppressed and the needy in any community. So, we have seen this unfailing character of GOD right from Genesis in the time of Jacob, while the Israelites were in Egypt. The Bible reveals the divine character of God and His attendant care towards the oppressed as in Ps. 12:5.\n“Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise,” says the Lord, “I will set him in the safety for which he longs.” (AMP)\nProv. 22:22-23\nDo not rob the poor because he is poor, or crush the oppressed or afflicted at the gate, for the Lord will plead their case, and take the life of those who rob them. (AMP)\nBeloved, as we glean wisdom and instructions from this practical study in the book of Esther, we shall encounter God’s unfailing and faithful character. His compassion and care towards the oppressed, the needy, and the poor in the society.\nFrom the scriptures quoted above, one thing is common, that God in His holiness and sovereignty fights for them. Also, we see that God does not close His eyes to them; but watches over them and hears their groaning; sees their affliction and empathizes with them.\nThe picture that readily comes to mind is that of a suckling child in the hand of a committed and compassionate nursing mother. Hardly will a genuine nursing mother ignore the cry of the suckling child at hand. She goes the extra way to pacify the suckling child and brings the child comfort and peace. This is exactly true of the character of God towards the oppressed and the needy.\nFriend, are you presently oppressed or harassed in your home, community, workplace, family, or church? Be patient, for help is on the way. For thus says the Lord, “I will not keep silent at this time of need, for through this pen of a writer, relief, deliverance, and righteousness like a river will flow to your hearts, spirit, and soul.” In Jesus Name. (emphasis mine).\nFor a few years past, God has been nudging and prompting me to put this personal, devotional journal into print format. It began with my regular personal devotion called ‘Alone with God’; pressed with on-going discipleship training and exposure. As a response to these continuous discipleship training and exposures, I went back to the Lord for further confirmation and clarification for the need in times like this?\nAnd one morning, by the strong leading of the Holy Spirit while discussing with my wife and my daughter, a clear impression with confirmation came deeply on my heart. Following this, while listening to a radio programme on BBC Radio 4, an inspiration came to my heart in the right direction to take.\nBeloved, I am very confident that God has begun a good thing within you through this gleaning/blog, and will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns. The Scripture says, “To each person, the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of ALL.”\nTherefore, it is with labour in obedience to God and much prayer, that you are reading this and many more gleanings/blogs. May you be enlightened, liberated, and transformed as you read it with much personal prayer, illumination, and practical application to your life. As you regularly read it with interest and profoundness of heart, may Christ Himself be formed in you as the Hope of Glory. Amen\nI welcome you to glean along with me with faith and devotion. God bless you.\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

We were all sinners, criminals and under the divine judgment of God to be sentenced to eternal death and total separation from God. But God the Father out of His great love sent God the Son-Jesus Christ to the earth in the likeness of human flesh to die for our sins. Jesus was born without sin (as we shall see in this outline); hence had no sinful nature.\nBut in order to fulfil the Will of the Father, He gave Himself as a Living sacrifice to save mankind from the power of sinful nature, self, Satan and the world system.\nGod did this by laying on Christ the iniquity of us all (Isaiah chapter 53 verse 6 says …’and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all’.) So, on the Cross Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; He was buried according to the scriptures, and on the third day, He arose from the grave according to the scriptures 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1 (KJV) –This is the Gospel.\nRomans chapter 1 verse 16 says: ‘For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek’.\nHere, Paul was not ashamed of the Gospel because it is God’s power to save men (whether Jew or Gentile). This gospel of Christ is the only comprehensive instrument and power that can deliver men from death to life in Christ Jesus, from sin to righteousness, from darkness to Light, from the bondage of the Old nature to the liberty of the New creature in Christ Jesus. No wonder in 1 Corinthians chapter 15: verse 1 Paul said, “For I delivered to you as of first importance…”. (ESV)\nTherefore, this Bible Study outline should be of first importance to all who diligently seek the Lord in Spirit and in Truth. It is of first importance to as many who are serious of making eternal life. Who have become tired of being under the mercy and tyranny of sin, Satan, and sinful nature? Since this is of first importance, it is therefore imperative that of all the Christian doctrines and teachings, the most essential and fundamental Christian teaching to any ministry.\n1.2 THE PURPOSE OF THIS BIBLE OUTLINE The singular pertinent and clear purpose for this Bible study outline can be found in the word of Brother Paul according to Colossians chapter 2 verse 2-3 says, “That their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .Colossians chapter 2 verse 2-3 says: [For my concern is] that their hearts may be braced (comforted, cheered, and encouraged) as they are knit together in love, that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding, and that they may become progressively more intimately acquainted with and may know more definitely and accurately and thoroughly that mystic secret of God, [which is] Christ (the Anointed One).In Him all the treasures of [divine] wisdom (comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God) and [all the riches of spiritual] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden. (AMPC)\nIt is my prayer that as you engage this outline you will be encouraged, strengthened, and enlightened in the inner man both to will, understand, and to do the Will of God. May you increase on all sides to the full riches of the glory of God in Christ Jesus. May the Holy Spirit illuminate your hearts and minds to the divine ways and purposes of God; even also to the hidden treasures stored up for you in Jesus name.\n1.3 Other Purposes Ther other purposes of this Outline are the following:\n It is to restate the Gospel in its simplicity and plainness of word.   It is a guide to knowing more about God’s pattern Son and how to be like Him in the newness of the spirit.   It does not replace the Bible and it is not more important than the Scripture.   It is a study aid to your Bible devotion or study in knowing God and His Son.   As you begin each study, pray that God will personally speak to you through His Word.   The explanations after each text, questions, or discussion are not conclusive but only to ignite you to further study for divine illumination and challenge.   It is therefore important that you carefully reflect on the texts, have with your personal notes to write down the Holy Spirit impression on your hearts for prayer, meditation, and action.   THE MYSTERY OF THE GOSPEL**** is an absolute truth that incorporates every aspect of the scripture (Old and New Testament). It is centred on Christ teachings, the Christian faith and the teaching of the Apostles. It is the heartbeat of becoming like Jesus for as long as we keep on believing in it because it is the Truth.\nThe other name for the Gospel is the Good news. It simply means that when I was deep in sin and disobedience, God’s mercy finds me through the revelation of the Word of God and I personally saw the crucified and the glorified Christ, and what He has done to save me. It must always point to Jesus. Not any man.\nBeloved, at the heart of the Good News stands the message of the atoning death and resurrection of Christ.\nRomans chapter 5 verses 8-10 says: But God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. (KJV)\nRomans chapter 6 verses 5-11 says: For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. (KJV)\nThis reveals that death, the death to self, sin, Satan and the world system is what gives birth to the life of Jesus Christ called THE NEW CREATION MAN. I must see Jesus being lifted up in my heart, therein I must see myself being nailed, beaten, pierced, died with Jesus the Man of Calvary. It is when this revelation dawns on me that the death of Christ can be activated upon my life in Mercy. Then said Jesus unto them, when ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. John chapter8 verse 28 (KJV)\nMore so, it also teaches us that without the Life quickening Spirit of God mankind would have continued to be under the sway of fear of death and sin. But thanks be to God who gives us victory through faith in Christ Jesus death and resurrection power!\nThere is something profound about the Christian teaching, whether in terms of its content, curriculum, methodology, communication, and objective. This profoundness is no other than the Power of the Gospel to change lives. Friends, whether you are a drunkard, fornicator, adulterer, robber, liar, idolater, abuser or effeminate, this Gospel is so powerful to change you and your sinful lifestyle.\nRomans chapter 1 verse 16 says: For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. (KJV)\nThis is so, because, it is not a marketing presentation, it is not a drama, not a discussion, a debate or argument. It is not a motivational speech or academic research findings. It is not a theory, not a hypothesis. It is the WORD OF GOD. It is the Mystery of the Gospel! It is powerful and effective. It is lifesaving and life-changing to those who believe and foolishness to them who are perishing.\nThis ‘Mystery’ was hidden from previous generations in the Old Testament by God but now, it has been revealed unto men by the Holy Spirit, that “CHRIST in You and I (earthly vessels), is the HOPE OF GLORY”! (T_he Mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His Saints._\n‘To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles:] which is Christ in you, the hope of glory).’ Colossians chapter 1 verse 26-27 (NKJV).\nAccording to 1 Timothy chapter 3, verse 16, the scripture says: “And without controversy great is the Mystery of Godliness”. For example: there is no contention, no debate, no argument, no another school of thought that ‘Great is the Mystery of the Gospel’!\nAs touching the Mystery of the Gospel, there is a Glory. This Glory is what can come to us if we so desire. This Glory we must diligently and deliberately seek in all our undertakings, not for ourselves, but for Christ Jesus who died, who was buried, who was raised and who ascended to Heaven in glory.\nAnd this glory is not just evident in our sermon, not even when Christ is preached just as an abstract or as an objective truth but actually evident when Christ in you, becomes the Hope of Glory. It is this hearing, hearing, hearing the TRUTH, that spring up our faith in Christ Jesus. And when this truth is applied accordingly in our lives, then it becomes evident as Christ in you, the Hope of Glory.\nJust like in the old generation, there were many mysteries, such as; mystery religions, mystery creed, mystery cults, some even believed in superstitions, galaxies, worship of sun, moon etc. So likewise, there are diverse mysteries today. The danger to all these strange mysteries is to regard the Mystery of the Gospel as one of them. Nevertheless, it has its mysteries (and we shall learn this in the outline). But it is not a superstitious belief like in the unknown god of Ephesus. Neither is it sentimental like New age or Eastern religion e.g. Yoga. For the truth is that, no one can deny how great is the Mystery of godliness.\n1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says: ‘And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.’ (KJV)\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

(Matthew 13:52).\nThe article section will majorly centre on inspired and divinely led Biblical principles that our sages imbibed and lived upon as recorded in the scripture. They will be in form of practical study outlines as guide to practical Christian growth. These principles will include Redemption, Justification, sanctification, Repentance from dead works, faith towards God, Godly marital principles, Discipleship, current news and the Church to mention just a few.\nWe do not intend to develop a theological or academic system of study outline. Our utmost intention and focus will be directed on actual impartation of Christ life on each reader, including the real-life experience of Gods divine purpose. They are not course work but spiritual aid to personal spiritual development. We also believe that as you patiently engage and follow the (article) study outline, your heart and mind will be ignited to seriously desire to know more about God.\nThis article section is aimed to provide additional insight and a stop gap to the familiar but time-limited church Bible class. It is our hope that it will impact your lives and open you to a broader exposure in a robust manner for your personal discipleship.\nThe articles may be used for group meetings, fellowship or even ministry purposes freely. You are free to run the Bible study as led by the Holy Spirit. Our prayer is that you will be deliberate and personal in engaging the series of articles. May you have a personal encounter with the Lord as you respond to each publication. May the living truth come to you with grace to respond to every instruction and spiritual dealings from the Lord.\nWe pray that you will grow in grace with your faith stirred and sharpened in faith to take up responsibility. Please continually pray to endure daily challenges, needs and trials that may come your way both for life and godliness. May you develop a positive spiritual perspective and vigour to stand and withstand them in your personal pilgrimage in Jesus name.\nEvery fullness of Christ\nGod bless you.\nStaff Editor.\nDo you have a question, comment or prayer request?

They are seeking to possess Him as their only treasure both for life and godliness. They passionately desire that God becomes their only desire, pleasure and treasure.\nHence, they are asking questions; how can these things be? What has God provided for mankind to know and walk with Him intimately in this Way? They reason that there is a yonder to knowing God beyond the pulpit. Here, for us as well, we have discovered there is no substitute to growing in the faith and grace unless we place a premium on our pursuit of knowing God in the new and living Way.\nSo, our mission is to take the Mystery of the Gospel beyond the pulpit, beyond fellowship and beyond regular meetings to everyone via this platform. We strongly believe that through this medium many will have a direct encounter with God, personally know Him, and learn how to develop an intimate personal and functional relationship with Him alone.\nOur Vision This ‘Mystery’ was hidden from previous generations in the Old Testament by God but now, it has been revealed unto men by the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, that “CHRIST in You (earthly vessels), is the HOPE OF GLORY”! (The Mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His Saints.‘To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles:] which is Christ in you, the hope of glory’) (Col.1:26-27).\nThis one thing, we will pursue until everyone come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect (complete and mature) man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
