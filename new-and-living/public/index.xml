Life is a journey that is measured in time and season. And in the journey of life, there are contentions and challenges. Our pilgrims’ journey cannot be void of attacks, battles and rages from the enemy. If there is nothing good about your journey in life, the enemy will not trouble you.</description>

The dream peak magnifies the attainment peak to make it real and pursuable.
But unfortunately minifies the valleys in between.
So, the youth is tricked to think that bright visions equal their achievement in life.</description>

      <description>KNOWING THIS… (Romans 6:6)
The majority of believers today are destroyed not because they pray; not because they fast; not because they do good deeds. But according to the Bible, God says, ‘My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. As good as self-discipline and rules in dealing with a problem are, they are only human efforts in dealing with the Old Man.</description>

Hi Friends,
Have you ever been under the influence of peers, friends or family? Do you ever do some things because ‘my friends do it?’ Do you have a clear opinion about things, or are your opinions always based on what your friends and family think, not what you actually think or God is saying to you?</description>

I have a quick question for you? Do you think that the Earth came by Evolution or Creation?
Whether you are Christian or not, what do you believe?
Did God exist before the beginning or after the beginning?
Does God know the end from the beginning? Did He create Heaven and the Earth?</description>

      <description>The Central Purpose The central pertinent purpose for this Bible study outline in podcast version can be found in the word of Brother Paul according to Colossians chapter 2 verse 2-3.
It says: (For my concern is] that their hearts may be braced (comforted, cheered, and encouraged) as they are knit together in love, that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding.</description>

      <description>God in His love gave us The Gospel, as His own Divine instrument for changing men.
We were all sinners, criminals, and under the divine judgment of God to be sentenced to eternal death and total separation from God.
But God the Father, out of His great love sent God the Son, Jesus Christ to the earth in the likeness of human flesh, to die for our sins.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Final Part )  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) What to do.
As we bring this article to a conclusion, I could see Joab was telling David what to do just as the Holy Spirit is presently speaking through various holy men and women what your response ought to be: God is speaking through Chats, songs, visions, dreams, prophecies, messages,; ‘Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants…’ What is God saying to you?</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 3)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) The case of Absalom.
Beloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**– (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 2)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 Who is this Old Man?
At this stage, there is a quiet introduction of the Old Man. And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead  Texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12. Let me begin by pointing your attention to the name ‘Absalom’. It is interesting to note here that the name Absalom means, ‘The father of Peace’. But sadly, you will discover that his lifestyle was a complete contrast to the true meaning of his name.</description>

      <description>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath.

      <description>Recently, someone told me that a part-time Christian can not defeat a full-time Devil. Can this be true statement? Do you wonder what this is all about?
What are the signs of the last days to watch out for, so that you don’t fall away?
In this world of convenience and ease, how can you practically engage in soul winning without recourse to discouragement, opposition and fear of past failure or being called a fanatic?</description>

      <description>This is the Part 2 of the question Jesus asked His disciples in Luke 18:8. When the Son of Man comes will He find faith on the earth?
Jesus did not give an answer to this question. He expects us to give answer to this question by our Word, Life, Love, Truth and Purity.</description>

      <description>1 .1 THE SINFUL NATURE As we continue this lesson, please note that the original man and the woman GOD made in His own image in Genesis 2, is not the same as the one in Gen 3. Sin drew away the sinless life from this container (our body) and another life (sinful nature) invaded this human body.</description>

      <description>In this Part 2, we closely looked at how critical is the lesson of having clear identity both for life and godliness. Dear young Person, quick question, do you wish to be exceptional in life?

      <description>The fundamental issue of being born again was raised by Christ before Nicodemus in John 3. This was because of the kind of life Nicodemus carried, but he was not aware of it. The problem with mankind is the specie of life he carries about in this earthen vessel. Mankind is not aware of the fallen nature dwelling within him, because nothing happened to the body (the container).</description>

      <description>The sin of unbelief is a serious one before the Lord. Millions of people perished in the wilderness because of it. Mankind becomes victim of unbelief when they mistrust or distrust the Lord and His Word. It is on this foothold that the tempter preys on the vulnerable people to make them to sin against God.</description>

      <description>1.1 Gleanings from Matthew 25:14-21  First and foremost, we are on a pilgrimage and we cannot afford to be distracted along the way. We have nothing of our own and we don’t own our self. We are bought at a price fully paid. We belong to the Lord. We are living a ‘borrowed life’, ‘borrowed time’.</description>

      <description>1.1 Preamble What then is a “Mystery”?
A ‘Mystery’ is a profound declaration of deep spiritual truth, as unveiled by God through divine inspiration and not of human ability or intelligence.
A Mystery is any truth that is unknowable by human training, except by divine revelation.
1.1.1 Biblical Definitions: a.} Ephesians chapter 3 verses 5 says: [This Mystery] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles (consecrated messengers) and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit.</description>

      <description>God Guiding and Controlling his Purpose Behind the Scene Gleanings from the book of Esther Chapter 1 Within my reach is a compelling verse in Heb.11:3, ‘By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible’.</description>

      <description>The Mystery of the Gospel 1.1 INTRODUCTION God in His love gave us The Gospel as His own Divine instrument for changing men. We were all sinners, criminals and under the divine judgment of God to be sentenced to eternal death and total separation from God. But God the Father out of His great love sent God the Son-Jesus Christ to the earth in the likeness of human flesh to die for our sins.</description>
