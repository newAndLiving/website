      <description>&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;EXPERIENCING GOD&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;  Anchor Text: Luke 19:1-10**.** Dear friends, in this series of life application studies on the life of Zacchaeus-the Chief Tax Collector, we shall be exploring the gateway into Experiencing God. Several characters in the Bible could not have been able to share their life experience with us if they did not encounter the Lord.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;Rehoboth&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;  Anchor Text: Genesis 26:1-22, 23-30. There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father.</description>

      <description>Marching on into the Year 2022  Texts: Numbers 21:1-9; Psalm 2:1-4.
Life is a journey that is measured in time and season. And in the journey of life, there are contentions and challenges. Our pilgrims‚Äô journey cannot be void of attacks, battles and rages from the enemy. If there is nothing good about your journey in life, the enemy will not trouble you.</description>

      <description>1.1¬†The Valley of Dry Bones ü¶¥ü¶¥ We have never heard of the mountain of dry bones but we have read of the valley of dry bones. Whose dead bones, were they?
Men who once pursued their visions with vigour, self-determination. Men who conceived their dreams with crystal clear vision and articulated them.</description>

      <description>1¬†Dear Young Mr Youth There are two peaks in life: the dream peak and the attainment peak.
The dream peak magnifies the attainment peak to make it real and pursuable.
But unfortunately minifies the valleys in between.
So, the youth is tricked to think that bright visions equal their achievement in life.</description>

      <description>KNOWING THIS‚Ä¶ (Romans 6:6)
The majority of believers today are destroyed not because they pray; not because they fast; not because they do good deeds. But according to the Bible, God says, ‚ÄòMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. As good as self-discipline and rules in dealing with a problem are, they are only human efforts in dealing with the Old Man.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Final Part )  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) What to do.
As we bring this article to a conclusion, I could see Joab was telling David what to do just as the Holy Spirit is presently speaking through various holy men and women what your response ought to be: God is speaking through Chats, songs, visions, dreams, prophecies, messages,; ‚ÄòNow therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants‚Ä¶‚Äô What is God saying to you?</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 3)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) The case of Absalom.
Beloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**‚Äì (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 2)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 Who is this Old Man?
At this stage, there is a quiet introduction of the Old Man. And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead  Texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12. Let me begin by pointing your attention to the name ‚ÄòAbsalom‚Äô. It is interesting to note here that the name Absalom means, ‚ÄòThe father of Peace‚Äô. But sadly, you will discover that his lifestyle was a complete contrast to the true meaning of his name.</description>

      <description>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest‚Äôs servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant‚Äôs name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, ‚ÄúPut your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?‚Äù (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)</description>

      <description>WHAT ARE THE PROVISIONS?  Since anything that comes with the sinful nature cannot please God, it means that God had a plan to deal with sins and the sinful nature. God truly does not want to bestow unending fame upon Mr. flesh at all. So, He made adequate provision for us to experience total deliverance from it.</description>

 It is not by shouting; talking about it; not by speaking in tongues; not by covering it up.</description>

      <description>The fundamental issue of being born again was raised by Christ before Nicodemus in John 3. This was because of the kind of life Nicodemus carried, but he was not aware of it. The problem with mankind is the specie of life he carries about in this earthen vessel. Mankind is not aware of the fallen nature dwelling within him, because nothing happened to the body (the container).</description>

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!
See, your king comes to you,

      <description>1.1¬†Gleanings from Matthew 25:14-21  First and foremost, we are on a pilgrimage and we cannot afford to be distracted along the way. We have nothing of our own and we don‚Äôt own our self. We are bought at a price fully paid. We belong to the Lord. We are living a ‚Äòborrowed life‚Äô, ‚Äòborrowed time‚Äô.</description>

      <description>1.1¬†Preamble What then is a ‚ÄúMystery‚Äù?
A ‚ÄòMystery‚Äô is a profound declaration of deep spiritual truth, as unveiled by God through divine inspiration and not of human ability or intelligence.
A¬†Mystery is any truth that is unknowable by human training, except by divine revelation.
1.1.1¬†Biblical Definitions: a.}¬†Ephesians¬†chapter¬†3¬†verses¬†5¬†says:¬†[This¬†Mystery] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles (consecrated messengers) and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit.</description>

      <description>God Guiding and Controlling his Purpose Behind the Scene Gleanings from the book of Esther Chapter 1 Within my reach is a compelling verse in Heb.11:3, ‚ÄòBy faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible‚Äô.</description>

      <description>The Mystery of the Gospel 1.1¬†INTRODUCTION God in His love gave us¬†The¬†Gospel as His own¬†Divine instrument for changing men. We were all sinners, criminals and under the divine judgment of God to be sentenced to eternal death and total separation from God. But God the Father out of His great love sent God the Son-Jesus Christ to the earth in the likeness of human flesh to die for our sins.</description>
