      <description>KNOWING THIS… (Romans 6:6)
The majority of believers today are destroyed not because they pray; not because they fast; not because they do good deeds. But according to the Bible, God says, ‘My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. As good as self-discipline and rules in dealing with a problem are, they are only human efforts in dealing with the Old Man.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 3)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) The case of Absalom.
Beloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**– (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 2)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 Who is this Old Man?
At this stage, there is a quiet introduction of the Old Man. And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom.</description>
