      <description>Absalom is dead (Final Part )  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) What to do.
As we bring this article to a conclusion, I could see Joab was telling David what to do just as the Holy Spirit is presently speaking through various holy men and women what your response ought to be: God is speaking through Chats, songs, visions, dreams, prophecies, messages,; ‘Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants…’ What is God saying to you?</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead  Texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12. Let me begin by pointing your attention to the name ‘Absalom’. It is interesting to note here that the name Absalom means, ‘The father of Peace’. But sadly, you will discover that his lifestyle was a complete contrast to the true meaning of his name.</description>

      <description>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?” (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)</description>

      <description>WHAT ARE THE PROVISIONS?  Since anything that comes with the sinful nature cannot please God, it means that God had a plan to deal with sins and the sinful nature. God truly does not want to bestow unending fame upon Mr. flesh at all. So, He made adequate provision for us to experience total deliverance from it.</description>

      <description>KEY TEXT: Rev. 12:10-11 (NKJV). So, for you to overcome the devil and his constant accusations, it is not by your own effort but by the “Blood of the Lamb and by the Word of your testimony.”
 It is not by shouting; talking about it; not by speaking in tongues; not by covering it up.</description>

      <description>1 .1 THE SINFUL NATURE As we continue this lesson, please note that the original man and the woman GOD made in His own image in Genesis 2, is not the same as the one in Gen 3. Sin drew away the sinless life from this container (our body) and another life (sinful nature) invaded this human body.</description>
