      <description>&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;Rehoboth&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;  Key Text: Genesis 26:1-22 There are different stations in the walk of a man with His God. Abraham, for example, travelled from Ur of the Chaldeans through Haran Egypt, Philistine to Canaan. Different landscapes had different connotations, demands and challenges. Similarly, Isaac traversed different terrains. God interrupted him in an attempted economic relocation to Egypt like Abraham, his father.</description>

      <description>Marching on into the Year 2022  Texts: Numbers 21:1-9; Psalm 2:1-4.
Life is a journey that is measured in time and season. And in the journey of life, there are contentions and challenges. Our pilgrims’ journey cannot be void of attacks, battles and rages from the enemy. If there is nothing good about your journey in life, the enemy will not trouble you.</description>
