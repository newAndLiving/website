      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 3)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) The case of Absalom.
Beloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**– (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 2)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 Who is this Old Man?
At this stage, there is a quiet introduction of the Old Man. And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom.</description>
