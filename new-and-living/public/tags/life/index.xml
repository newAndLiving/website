      <description>1 Dear Young Mr Youth There are two peaks in life: the dream peak and the attainment peak.
The dream peak magnifies the attainment peak to make it real and pursuable.
But unfortunately minifies the valleys in between.
So, the youth is tricked to think that bright visions equal their achievement in life.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Final Part )  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) What to do.
As we bring this article to a conclusion, I could see Joab was telling David what to do just as the Holy Spirit is presently speaking through various holy men and women what your response ought to be: God is speaking through Chats, songs, visions, dreams, prophecies, messages,; ‘Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants…’ What is God saying to you?</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 3)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 (KJV) The case of Absalom.
Beloved, from this narrative the clear picture emerging, is that first, the Old Man deserves death so that mankind can live for the Lord. Hence, whatever represents the character, conduct, and conversation of the Absalom**– (Old Man**) in your life must be terminated before you can be useful unto God and His Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead (Part 2)  Key texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12; Rom.6:6-7 Who is this Old Man?
At this stage, there is a quiet introduction of the Old Man. And this created another species of mankind different from the innocent Adam that God created in Genesis 2. Subsequently from this point, we will be looking at the nature of this fallen man and its application to the narrative on Absalom.</description>

      <description>Absalom is dead  Texts: 11 Sam 18:33; 19:1-12. Let me begin by pointing your attention to the name ‘Absalom’. It is interesting to note here that the name Absalom means, ‘The father of Peace’. But sadly, you will discover that his lifestyle was a complete contrast to the true meaning of his name.</description>

      <description>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. So, JESUS said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?” (John 18:10-11 NKJV; Luke 12:50; Luke 22:36,38,42; Mark 10:38;14:36 NLT;)</description>

      <description>WHAT ARE THE PROVISIONS?  Since anything that comes with the sinful nature cannot please God, it means that God had a plan to deal with sins and the sinful nature. God truly does not want to bestow unending fame upon Mr. flesh at all. So, He made adequate provision for us to experience total deliverance from it.</description>

      <description>KEY TEXT: Rev. 12:10-11 (NKJV). So, for you to overcome the devil and his constant accusations, it is not by your own effort but by the “Blood of the Lamb and by the Word of your testimony.”
 It is not by shouting; talking about it; not by speaking in tongues; not by covering it up.</description>

      <description>1.1: THE THREE ASPECTS OF MAN    Mankind is of three components: A man has a spirit, with a soul inside the body. (1Thess. 5:23).   THE SPIRIT (Consist of our Intuition, fellowship and conscience) &amp;#8211; The Generating/Manufacturing Centre.  THE SOUL (Comprises of our Intellect, Will and Emotion &amp;#8211; The Warehouse.</description>

      <description>1 .1 THE SINFUL NATURE As we continue this lesson, please note that the original man and the woman GOD made in His own image in Genesis 2, is not the same as the one in Gen 3. Sin drew away the sinless life from this container (our body) and another life (sinful nature) invaded this human body.</description>

      <description>You can seek and find God too late,
Know Jesus and the faith too late,
Realize the value of life too late,
Appreciate the reach of mercy too late,
Comprehend the use of grace too late.  Alas! No one arrives eternity late, But on that cloudless day:
Tears and sorrow for sin will be too late</description>
